may be able to leverage these broader product offerings to adversely affect K2s competitive market position. Further, there are no significant technological or capital barriers to entry into the markets for many sporting goods and recreational

working capital requirements and hence overall financing needs. In addition, K2s borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility is impacted by the seasonal change in receivables and inventory. The seasonality of K2s businesses

may demand better prices and terms from K2, and these demands may have an adverse impact on K2s margins. In addition, if any of these large format sporting goods retailers were to decide to materially reduce the amounts or types of K2 products

K2 purchases a substantial portion of these raw materials from third
party suppliers, and the cost of these raw materials represents a substantial portion of our cost of products sold. In recent periods, K2 has experienced significantly higher crude oil prices, which have resulted in increased prices for resin-based
products. In addition, the fluctuations of supply and demand for raw materials have led to increased price volatility. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Although K2 frequently enters into supply agreements to acquire these raw materials, these agreements typically provide for market based pricing and
provide K2 only limited protection against price volatility. While K2 attempts to match cost increases with corresponding product price increases, K2 is not always able to raise product prices immediately or at all. Timing differences between raw
material prices, which may change daily, and contract product prices, which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often, have had and may continue to have a negative effect on profitability. If any of K2s suppliers is unable to
meet its obligations under present supply agreements, K2 may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials from other sources, and K2 may not be able to increase prices for finished products to recoup the higher raw materials
cost. In addition, if any of the raw materials that K2 uses becomes unavailable within the geographic area from which they are now sourced, then K2 may not be able to obtain cost-effective substitutes. Any underlying cost increase that K2 is not
able to pass on to customers or any interruption in supply of raw materials could increase K2s costs or decrease revenues, which could reduce profitability. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>K2 may be required to recognize future intangible impairment charges. </b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Pursuant to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), K2 is required to test its
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine if they are impaired. Such tests are required to be done annually or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce
the fair value the asset below its carrying amount. Disruptions to K2s business, protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, and market capitalization declines may result in additional
charges for goodwill and other intangible asset impairments. Future impairment charges could substantially affect K2s reported earnings in the periods of such charges. In addition, such charges would further reduce K2s ability to make
cash dividends, investments, stock repurchases and early payment of debt subordinated to K2s 7.375% senior notes due July 2014 because of restrictions set forth in K2s indenture governing such notes.</font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Changes in currency exchange rates could affect K2s revenues. </b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">A significant portion of K2s production and approximately 25% of
K2s sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to exchange rate fluctuation risk. Although K2 engages in some hedging activities to reduce foreign exchange transaction risk, changes in
the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of Europe and Asia could make K2 products less competitive in foreign markets, and could reduce the sales and earnings represented by foreign currencies. Additionally, such fluctuation
could result in an increase in cost of products sold in foreign markets reducing margins and earnings. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Acts of war or terrorism may have an adverse effect on K2s business. </b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Acts of war or terrorism may have an adverse effect on the economy generally, and more specifically on K2s business, financial condition, results of

govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as handling and disposal of and exposure to hazardous substances. In that regard, K2 has been and could be subject to claims and inquiries
related to alleged substances in K2s products that may be subject to notice requirements or exposure limitations, particularly in California, which may result in fines and penalties. K2 is also subject to laws and regulations that impose
liability for cost and damages resulting from past disposals or other releases of hazardous substances. For example, K2 may incur liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and
similar laws, some of which impose strict, and in some cases, joint and several, liability for the cleanup of contamination resulting from past disposals of waste, including disposal at off-site locations. K2 is currently aware of matters involving
discharge of hazardous materials at old waste sites in South Carolina and Michigan. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, K2 had recorded an estimated liability of approximately $800,000 for environmental matters. In addition, K2 has acquired and
intends to continue to acquire pre-existing businesses, such as Rawlings, Völkl, Marker and Marmot, that have historical and ongoing operations, and K2 has limited information about the environmental condition of the properties of such
companies. It is possible that soil and groundwater contamination may exist on these or other of K2s properties resulting from current or former operations. Although K2 is not aware of any issues arising under current environmental laws that
would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on K2s business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects, K2 cannot assure you that such matters will not have such an impact. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>Unfavorable weather can adversely affect K2s sales. </b></font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Sales of K2s sporting goods and recreational products are strongly

In the ordinary course of our
business there are calculations and transactions, including transfer pricing, where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, changes in tax laws and regulations as well as adverse judicial rulings could adversely affect the income
tax provision. K2 believes that it has adequately provided for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. However, if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities, an additional charge
to expense would result. K2 has established a valuation allowance against certain of its deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction where it can not conclude that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized. If actual results are less
favorable than those projected by management, additional income tax expense could be required. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><b>
