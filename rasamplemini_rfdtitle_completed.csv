0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of that"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high fuel and oil prices, lack of capital, and weak economic"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"conditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the global"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"financial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limited"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft."
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,reduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected.
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"Further, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additional"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"airline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"credit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations."
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including the"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,increased in-house maintenance by airlines;
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,lack of parts in the marketplace;
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and

0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $304.3 million (17.4% of consolidated"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,sales) in fiscal 2018 (See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government sales is for products and services supporting DoD logistics and mobility

0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"including the level of troop deployment worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints."
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation, including the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt (the ""debt ceiling""). These issues could negatively affect the"

0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,congressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federal
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,programs we support in particular.
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"there are funding delays and constraints, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S. government is"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"unable to make timely payments. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,contracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts.

0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and other"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in cost"

0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,Success at our airframe maintenance facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines.
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities at seven leased locations. Revenues at these facilities fluctuate"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain airlines operate"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the required airframe
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"maintenance, repair and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute our operational"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"and financial plans at our maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition."
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"We operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us."
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face competition"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, other"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors, and other expeditionary airlift service providers. Some of our competitors"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. These competitive markets also create pressure on our
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,ability to hire and retain qualified technicians and other skilled labor needs. We believe that our
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"to compete depends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing and effective quality assurance programs."
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"government customers, including the DoD, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize small business contractors"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,or determine to source work internally rather than use us. We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Bid protests could result in significant expense for
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"us, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on both our"
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,"commercial and government business, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition."
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply with
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,new or more stringent governmental regulation.
0000001750,2018,7/11/2018,,The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before we sell

0000001800,2017,2/17/2017,,meet its debt obligations. Abbott utilizes the short- and long-term debt markets to obtain capital from time to time. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs
0000001800,2017,2/17/2017,,"for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive"

0000001800,2016,2/19/2016,,The international nature of Abbott's business subjects it to additional business risks that may

0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets."
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.

0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for

0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of"

0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested."
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical"

0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott's existing products, they may be quickly"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things,"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched,"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new"

0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements."
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters,"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"have to be discarded. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause,"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. To the"

0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,from Abbott and the relationship between the two companies going forward. These arrangements could lead to disputes between Abbott and AbbVie over Abbott's rights to certain shared property and rights
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations. The separation and distribution agreement also provides for, among other things, indemnification obligations designed to make"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"AbbVie financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after AbbVie's separation from Abbott, as well as"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,those obligations of Abbott assumed by AbbVie pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement. It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between Abbott and AbbVie and
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,require Abbott to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to AbbVie. Third parties could also seek to hold Abbott responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations. The indemnity rights
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"Abbott has under the separation agreement may not be sufficient to protect Abbott. Even if Abbott is successful in obtaining indemnification, Abbott may have to bear losses temporarily. In addition,"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,obligations to AbbVie may be significant. These risks could negatively affect Abbott's results of operations.
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,There could be significant liability if the distribution of AbbVie common stock to Abbott
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"Abbott received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the effect that, among other things, the separation"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,and the distribution of AbbVie qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). In
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"addition, Abbott received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D)"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"of the Code. The ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Abbott and AbbVie regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, Abbott and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the receipt by Abbott of the private letter ruling from the IRS and opinion of tax counsel, the IRS"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of Abbott or"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"AbbVie after the separation. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Abbott and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,Abbott holds a significant investment in Mylan N.V. and is subject to market risk.

0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"in exchange, received 110,000,000 Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. As long as Abbott holds the shares, Abbott will have a substantial undiversified equity investment in Mylan and, therefore, will be"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,subject to the risk of changes in the market value of those shares.

0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"Although Abbott's financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott's revenues and costs are"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,realized in other currencies. Abbott's profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"may also affect the reported value of Abbott's assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging"
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,"arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks."
0000001800,2015,2/27/2015,,The international nature of Abbott's business subjects it to additional business risks that may

0000004962,2011,2/28/2011,,The Companys results for 2010 reflected strong spending
0000004962,2011,2/28/2011,,growth and improved credit performance. Throughout the year
0000004962,2011,2/28/2011,,cardmember spending volumes grew both in the United States and
0000004962,2011,2/28/2011,,"internationally, and across all of the Companys"
0000004962,2011,2/28/2011,,businesses. Cardmember spending levels in 2010 reached record
0000004962,2011,2/28/2011,,levels at the end of the year. Improving credit trends
0000004962,2011,2/28/2011,,contributed to the reduction in loan and receivable write-offs
0000004962,2011,2/28/2011,,and the reduction of loss reserve levels over the course of 2010
0000004962,2011,2/28/2011,,when compared to 2009. It is expected that the
0000004962,2011,2/28/2011,,benefits from improving credit trends will decrease over the
0000004962,2011,2/28/2011,,course of 2011. While the Company invested at historically high
