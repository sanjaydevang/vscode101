18. Our operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.
19. The following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business.
20. As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of that industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high fuel and oil prices, lack of capital, and weak economic conditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the global financial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limited their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft.
21. A reduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected. Further, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additional airline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight credit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
22. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including the following:
23. deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;
24. reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;
25. retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;
26. reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;
27. increased in-house maintenance by airlines;
28. lack of parts in the marketplace;
29. acts of terrorism;
30. future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and
31. acts of God.
32. Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $304.3 million (17.4% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2018 (See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government sales is for products and services supporting DoD logistics and mobility strategy and is, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our contracts with the U.S. government and their contractors are typically agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of the government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of
33. Table of Contents
34. factors, including the level of troop deployment worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints.
35. U.S. government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation, including the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt (the "debt ceiling"). These issues could negatively affect the timely collection of our U.S. government invoices.
36. Future congressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular.
37. If there are funding delays and constraints, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
38. We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing for fixed unit prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and other unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
39. We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities at seven leased locations. Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain airlines operate certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the required airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute our operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
40. The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face competition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors, and other expeditionary airlift service providers. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. These competitive markets also create pressure on our ability to hire and retain qualified technicians and other skilled labor needs. We believe that our
41. ability to compete depends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing and effective quality assurance programs.
42. Our government customers, including the DoD, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally rather than use us. We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Bid protests could result in significant expense for us, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on both our commercial and government business, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
43. The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before we sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.
44. If any of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
45. We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. These laws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and orders restricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information and safeguarding of contractor information systems. Certain government contracts provide audit rights by government agencies, including with respect to performance, costs, business systems, internal controls and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if a government audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions, including suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. Our reputation could suffer harm if allegations of impropriety were made or found against us, which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue.
46. We conduct our business in a number of foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts. Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:
47. military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;
48. export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;
49. compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom ("UK") Anti-bribery Act, and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws;
50. the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;
51. contract award and funding delays;
52. potential restrictions on transfers of funds;
53. import and export duties and value added taxes;
54. foreign exchange risk;
55. transportation delays and interruptions;
56. uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and
57. changes in U.S. policies on trade relations and trade policy, including implementation of or changes in trade sanctions, tariffs, and embargoes.
58. In addition, the UK held a referendum in 2016 in which voters approved an exit from the European Union ("EU"). On March 29, 2017, the UK government commenced the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty of the EU by notifying the European Council of the UK's intention to leave the EU. This notification started a two-year time period for the UK and the remaining EU countries to negotiate a withdrawal agreement. The final terms of the UK's potential exit from the EU have yet to be determined and it is possible there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU countries along with increased regulatory complexities.
59. While we have adopted and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, such measures may not be adequate, and the regions in which we operate might not continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all.
60. We have completed multiple acquisitions over the past few years and we have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. For any businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
61. We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of rotable components, engines, and other assets which are on lease, available for lease, or supporting our long-term programs. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Reductions in demand for these assets or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our aircraft, engines, and other assets could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
62. We own and distribute a significant amount of engines, aircraft parts and components, and manufacturing facilities and related equipment. The removal of aircraft from service or recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of those assets and record an impairment charge through earnings to reduce the carrying value. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized impairment charges of $54.2 million related to assets included in our COCO business which is classified as a discontinued operation. In addition, if aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.
63. We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of our assets including historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our assets could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
64. We have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $9.8 million related to our COCO business. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or one of our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilities were to lose its authority to operate, we might be required to record an impairment charge.
65. Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debt and equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviation industry, our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
66. Certain financing arrangements, including our Revolving Credit Facility and our accounts receivable financing program, require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements and may result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our
67. failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
68. Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death which may result if an engine, engine part or component, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product which we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products are installed, crashes. We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industry norms. However, claims may arise in the future, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
69. Our businesses depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. The Company's systems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, ransomware attacks, terrorist acts, natural disasters, power failures or other causes. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.
70. Cyber security threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, ransomware attacks, including our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.
71. The procedures and controls we utilize to monitor and mitigate these threats may not be sufficient to prevent security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, and financial condition.
72. Moreover, expenditures incurred in implementing and maintaining cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
73. Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required to pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
74. Future environmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increase operating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the United States, foreign
75. governments, the International Civil Aviation Organization, or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits.
76. The industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment, and methods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with any new technological developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
77. We are dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce because of the complex nature of many of our products and services. Furthermore, we have a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 155 employees. Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers' demands could be jeopardized if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including qualified licensed mechanics, to conduct our business, or if we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage. These and similar events may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

19. Our operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.
20. The following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business.
21. As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of that industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high fuel and oil prices, lack of capital, and weak economic conditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the global financial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limited their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft.
22. A reduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected. Further, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additional airline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight credit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
23. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including the following:
24. deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;
25. reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;
26. retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;
27. reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;
28. increased in-house maintenance by airlines;
29. lack of parts in the marketplace;
30. acts of terrorism;
31. future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and
32. acts of God.
33. Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $454.8 million (25.7% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2017 (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government contracts is for products and services supporting DoD logistics and mobility strategy, as well as for expeditionary airlift services and is, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our contracts with the U.S. government, including the DoD and its contractors, are typically agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of the government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop
34. Table of Contents
35. deployment worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints.
36. U.S. government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the "Budget Act") which raised the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt (the debt ceiling) until March 2017 and raised the sequester caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The suspension of the federal debt limit has not been extended beyond March 2017 which could negatively affect the timely collection of our U.S. government invoices.
37. Future congressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular.
38. If the existing federal debt limit is not raised, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
39. We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing for fixed unit prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and other unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
40. We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities at five leased facilities. Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain airlines operate certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the required airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute our operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
41. The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face competition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors, and other expeditionary airlift service providers. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. We believe that our ability to compete depends
42. on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing and effective quality assurance programs.
43. Our government customers, including the DoD, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally rather than use us. We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Bid protests could result in significant expense for us, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on both our commercial and government business, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
44. The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before we sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.
45. If any of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
46. We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. These laws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and orders restricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information. Certain government contracts provide audit rights by government agencies, including with respect to performance, costs, internal controls and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if a government audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions, including suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. Our reputation could suffer harm if allegations of impropriety were made or found against us, which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue.
47. Our expeditionary airlift business derives a significant portion of its revenue from providing expeditionary airlift services in Afghanistan for the DoD. The U.S. has been reducing military activities in Afghanistan and the number of troops in Afghanistan is currently less than 10,000. Our expeditionary
48. airlift services revenue will likely experience further declines should troop reductions occur in Afghanistan or we do not receive task orders for future services under our indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract awards.
49. We are bidding on expeditionary airlift contracts in other regions supporting both DoD and non-DoD customers, although there can be no assurance we will be awarded any of these contracts. Although we expect ongoing demand for expeditionary airlift services in Afghanistan and other regions from the DoD and other governmental departments, we are exposed to the risk that our expeditionary airlift revenues may further decline if contracts are not renewed, renewed only in part, or are terminated, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to successfully redeploy aircraft not actively supporting current customers at favorable rates or sell them on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
50. U.S. government contractors that provide support services in theaters of conflict such as Afghanistan have come under increasing scrutiny by agency inspectors general, government auditors and congressional committees. Investigations pursued by any or all of these groups may result in additional expense, adverse publicity for us and reputational harm, regardless of the underlying merit of the allegations being investigated.
51. We conduct our business in a number of foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts. Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:
52. military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;
53. export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;
54. compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom ("UK") Anti-bribery Act, and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws;
55. the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;
56. contract award and funding delays;
57. potential restrictions on transfers of funds;
58. import and export duties and value added taxes;
59. foreign exchange risk;
60. transportation delays and interruptions;
61. uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations; and
62. changes in U.S. policies on trade relations and trade policy, including implementation of or changes in trade sanctions, tariffs, and embargoes.
63. In addition, the UK held a referendum in 2016 in which voters approved an exit from the European Union ("EU"). On March 29, 2017, the UK government commenced the exit process under Article 50 of the Treaty of the EU by notifying the European Council of the UK's intention to leave the EU. This notification starts a two-year time period for the UK and the remaining EU countries to negotiate a withdrawal agreement. The terms of the UK's potential exit from the EU have yet to be determined and it is possible there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU countries along with increased regulatory complexities.
64. While we have adopted and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, such measures may not be adequate, and the regions in which we operate might not continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all.
65. We explore and have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. For any businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
66. We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of aircraft, engines, and other assets which are on lease or available for lease. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Reductions in demand for these assets or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our aircraft, engines, and other assets could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
67. We lease aircraft and engines to our customers on an operating lease basis. Our ability to re-lease or sell these assets on acceptable terms when the lease expires is subject to a number of factors which drive industry capacity, including new aircraft deliveries, availability of used aircraft and engines in the marketplace, competition, financial condition of our customers, overall health of the airline industry, and general economic conditions. Our inability to re-lease or sell aircraft and engines could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
68. We own and distribute a significant amount of aircraft, aircraft parts and components, and manufacturing facilities and related equipment. The removal of aircraft from service or recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of those assets and record an impairment charge through earnings to reduce the carrying value. We recognized impairment charges and other losses of $71.4 million in fiscal 2015 related to our actions to address underperforming product lines and inventories. In addition, if aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.
69. We have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or one of our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilities were to lose its authority to operate, we might be required to record an impairment charge.
70. Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debt and equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviation industry, our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
71. Certain loan and debt agreements, including our Revolving Credit Facility, require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements and may result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
72. Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death which may result if an engine, engine part or component, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product which we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products are installed, crashes. We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industry norms. However, claims may arise in the future, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
73. Our businesses depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. The Company's systems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, ransomware attacks, terrorist acts, natural disasters, power failures or other causes. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.
74. Cyber security threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, ransomware attacks, including our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.
75. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, these procedures and controls may not be sufficient to prevent security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, and financial condition.
76. Moreover, expenditures incurred in implementing and maintaining cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
77. Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required to pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
78. Future environmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increase operating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the United States, foreign governments, the International Civil Aviation Organization, or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits.
79. The industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment, and methods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with any new technological developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
80. We are dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce because of the complex nature of many of our products and services. Furthermore, we have a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 125 employees. Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers' demands could be jeopardized if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including qualified licensed mechanics, to conduct our business, or if we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage. These and similar events may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

19. Our operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.
20. The following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business.
21. As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of that industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high fuel and oil prices, lack of capital, and weak economic conditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the global financial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limited their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft.
22. A reduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected. Further, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additional airline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight credit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
23. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including the following:
24. deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;
25. reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;
26. retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;
27. reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines;
28. increased in-house maintenance by airlines;
29. lack of parts in the marketplace;
30. terrorist attacks;
31. future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and
32. acts of God.
33. Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $513.8 million (30.9% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2016 (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government contracts is for products and services supporting DoD logistics and mobility strategy, as well as for expeditionary airlift services and is, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our contracts with the U.S. government, including the DoD and its contractors, are typically agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of the government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop
34. Table of Contents
35. deployment worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints.
36. The President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the "Budget Act") on November 2, 2015. The Budget Act raises the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt until March 2017 and raises the sequester caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. However, unforeseen circumstances could cause an extended debt ceiling breach, which could negatively affect the timely collection of our U.S. government invoices.
37. Future congressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federal debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and programs we support in particular.
38. If the existing federal debt limit is not raised, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
39. We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing for fixed unit prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and other unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
40. We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities at five leased facilities. Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain airlines operate certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the required airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute our operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
41. The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face competition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors, and other expeditionary airlift service providers. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. We believe that our ability to compete depends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing and effective quality assurance programs.
42. Our government customers, including the DoD, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally rather than use us. We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Bid protests could result in significant expense for us, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on both our commercial and government business, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
43. The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before we sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us.
44. If any of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
45. We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. These laws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and orders restricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information. Certain government contracts provide audit rights by government agencies, including with respect to performance, costs, internal controls and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if a government audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions, including suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. Our reputation could suffer harm if allegations of impropriety were made or found against us, which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue.
46. Our expeditionary airlift business derives a significant portion of its revenue from providing expeditionary airlift services in Afghanistan for the DoD. The U.S. has been reducing military activities in Afghanistan and had previously announced plans to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan to 5,500 by the end of calendar year 2016. Recent announcements by the President have indicated the draw down will be slower than originally planned due to the precarious security situation in Afghanistan with the
47. number of troops expected to be 8,400 by January 2017. Our expeditionary airlift services revenue will likely experience further declines should troop reductions occur in Afghanistan.
48. We are bidding on expeditionary airlift contracts in other regions supporting both DoD and non-DoD customers, although there can be no assurance we will be awarded any of these contracts. Although we expect ongoing demand for expeditionary airlift services in Afghanistan and other regions from the DoD and other governmental departments, we are exposed to the risk that our expeditionary airlift revenues may further decline if contracts are not renewed, renewed only in part, or are terminated, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to successfully redeploy aircraft not actively supporting current customers at favorable rates or sell them on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
49. U.S. government contractors that provide support services in theaters of conflict such as Afghanistan have come under increasing scrutiny by agency inspectors general, government auditors and congressional committees. Investigations pursued by any or all of these groups may result in additional expense, adverse publicity for us and reputational harm, regardless of the underlying merit of the allegations being investigated.
50. We conduct our business in certain foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts. Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:
51. military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks;
52. export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;
53. compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom ("UK") Anti-bribery Act, and other anti-bribery laws;
54. the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;
55. contract award and funding delays;
56. potential restrictions on transfers of funds;
57. import and export duties and value added taxes;
58. foreign exchange risk;
59. transportation delays and interruptions; and
60. uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations.
61. In addition, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union ("EU"). The terms of the UK's potential exit from the EU have yet to be determined and it is possible there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU countries along with increased regulatory complexities.
62. While we have adopted and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, we cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate or that the regions in which we operate will continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all.
63. We explore and have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. For any businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
64. We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of inventories, aircraft, and engines, which are on lease or available for lease. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Reductions in demand for our inventories or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our inventories, aircraft, and engines, could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
65. We lease aircraft and engines to our customers on an operating lease basis. Our ability to re-lease or sell these assets on acceptable terms when the lease expires is subject to a number of factors which drive industry capacity, including new aircraft deliveries, availability of used aircraft and engines in the marketplace, competition, financial condition of our customers, overall health of the airline industry, and general economic conditions. Our inability to re-lease or sell aircraft and engines could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
66. We own and distribute a significant amount of aircraft, aircraft parts and components, and manufacturing facilities and related equipment. The removal of aircraft from service or recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of those assets and record an impairment charge through earnings to reduce the carrying value. We recognized impairment charges and other losses of $71.4 million in fiscal 2015 related to our actions to address underperforming product lines and inventories. In addition, if aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.
67. We have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or one of our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilities were to lose its authority to operate, we might be required to record an impairment charge.
68. Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debt and equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviation industry, our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not
69. continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
70. Certain loan and debt agreements, including our Credit Facility, require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements and may result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
71. Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death which may result if an engine, engine part or component, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product which we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products are installed, crashes. We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industry norms. However, claims may arise in the future, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
72. Our businesses depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. The Company's systems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, terrorist acts, natural disasters, power failures or other causes. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor.
73. Cyber security threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, including our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data.
74. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, and financial condition.
75. Moreover, expenditures incurred in implementing cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
76. Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other
77. activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required to pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
78. Future environmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increase operating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the United States, foreign governments, the International Civil Aviation Organization, or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry.

12. New products and technological advances by Abbott's competitors may negatively affect Abbott's results of operations.
13. The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott's business could suffer.
14. Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott's products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and financial condition.
15. Abbott cannot predict at this time whether or when it will consummate the acquisition of Alere Inc.
16. Abbott holds a significant investment in Mylan N.V. and is subject to market risk.
17. Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and Abbott's ability to realize projected sales and earnings.
18. Deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbott's results of operations.
19. The international nature of Abbott's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.
20. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.
21. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
22. In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott's actual results. Abbott's business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.
23. Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity.
24. In the United States and other countries, Abbott's businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned "Regulation." To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors, Abbott's future revenues and operating income will be reduced.
25. Abbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and in substantial additional costs.
26. In addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott's products, and criminal prosecution.
27. These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott's suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability and financial condition.
28. Abbott's industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott's business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition.
29. Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to our products' coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott's products or the prices that Abbott's customers are willing to pay for them.
30. Further, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 change access to health care products and services and establish certain fees for the medical device industry. These provisions may be modified, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.
31. For additional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in "Regulation" under Item 1, "Business."
32. Following the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness as of January 31, 2017 is approximately $27.8 billion, representing a substantial increase in comparison to Abbott's consolidated indebtedness on a recent historical basis. This increased consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, increasing Abbott's consolidated interest expense, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes.
33. Further, Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on
34. terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition. Additionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating.
35. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its debt obligations. Abbott utilizes the short- and long-term debt markets to obtain capital from time to time. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility. Macroeconomic conditions, such as continued or increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, may adversely affect Abbott's ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capital-intensive internal initiatives.
36. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott's information technology systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, problems with product functionality, damage to customer relations, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties.
37. Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Any significant attack or other disruption on Abbott's systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business.
38. Many of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott's intellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property, Abbott's future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott's patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned "Legal Proceedings."
39. Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition.
40. To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.
41. Promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott's existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott's products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott's revenues and operating results to suffer.
42. Abbott's products face intense competition from its competitors' products. Competitors' products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott's products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors' products.
43. The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause,
44. similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability.
45. Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product's label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott's products.
46. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business and reputation and on Abbott's ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition.
47. On January 30, 2016, Abbott entered into a merger agreement to acquire Alere Inc. Since entering into the merger agreement, several key developments occurred with respect to Alere, including three new, separate investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (two of which are criminal investigations), delays in the filing of Alere's required annual (Form 10-K) and quarterly (Form 10-Q) SEC reports, management's disclosure of unremediated material weaknesses over financial reporting, the issuance of an opinion by Alere's auditors that Alere did not maintain effective internal control because of material weaknesses over financial reporting related to revenue recognition, a product recall following notice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the revocation of the Medicare billing privileges of an Alere business unit by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. These developments led Abbott to file a complaint against Alere in the Delaware Court of Chancery, seeking to terminate the merger agreement on the grounds that Alere has experienced a "material adverse effect" under the merger agreement and has materially breached certain of its covenants. The outcome of the lawsuit, however, is not certain, and Abbott cannot predict at this time whether or when it will consummate the acquisition of Alere.
48. In February 2015, Abbott completed the disposition of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business to Mylan N.V. in exchange for 110,000,000 Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. In April 2015, Abbott sold 40,250,000 of these Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. Abbott currently owns 69,750,000 ordinary shares. As long as Abbott holds the shares, Abbott will have a substantial undiversified equity investment in Mylan N.V. and, therefore, will be subject to the risk of changes in the market value of those shares.
49. Although Abbott's financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott's revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2016 made up approximately 70 percent of Abbott's net sales. Abbott's profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott's assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks.
50. Information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott's financial results is contained in the "Financial Review  Results of Operations" section in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Abbott's 2016 Form 10-K. Information on Abbott's hedging arrangements is contained in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in this report.
51. Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott's collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott's receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbott's customers depend on payment by government health care systems.
52. Abbott's business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States in 2016 made up approximately 70 percent of Abbott's net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott's international operations include:
53. differing local product preferences and product requirements;
54. trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;
55. difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations;
56. differing labor regulations;
57. potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;
58. political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;
59. restrictions on local currency conversion and/or cash extraction;
60. price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;
61. inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates;
62. compulsory licensing or diminished protection of intellectual property; and
63. potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.
64. Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability.
65. Many other factors can affect Abbott's profitability and its financial condition, including:
66. changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, product labeling, source and use laws, and environmental laws;
67. differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles, goodwill, and contingent consideration; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;
68. changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott's equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott's employee benefit trusts;
69. changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott's employee benefit trusts;
70. changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters; widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups;
71. changes in Abbott's business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future;
72. changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners; and
73. legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions.
74. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates, and projections. Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "forecasts," variations of these words, and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Certain factors, including but not limited to those identified under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K, may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations, estimates, projections, forecasts, and from past results. No assurance can be made that any expectation, estimate, or projection contained in a forward-looking statement will be achieved or will not be affected by the factors cited above or other future events. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as the result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.

20. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
21. In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott's actual results. Abbott's business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.
22. Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.
23. In the United States and other countries, Abbott's businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned "Regulation." To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors, Abbott's future revenues and operating income will be reduced.
24. Abbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and in substantial additional costs.
25. In addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott's products, and criminal prosecution.
26. These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of Abbott's facilities while Abbott or Abbott's suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability and financial condition.
27. Abbott's industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott's business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition.
28. Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, or make adverse decisions relating to our products' coverage or reimbursement, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of our products or the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.
29. In the U.S., a number of the provisions of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 change access to health care products and services and establish new fees for the medical device industry. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking.
30. For additional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in "Regulation" under Item 1, "Business."
31. Many of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott's intellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property, Abbott's future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Litigation regarding Abbott's patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned "Legal Proceedings."
32. Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition.
33. To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.
34. Promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott's existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause Abbott's products to become obsolete, causing Abbott's revenues and operating results to suffer.
35. Abbott's products face intense competition from its competitors' products. Competitors' products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott's products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors' products.
36. The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause,
37. similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability.
38. Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product's label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott's products.
39. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business and reputation and on Abbott's ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition.
40. Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott's collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott's receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems.
41. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies makes them vulnerable to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause data relating to customers or Abbott's proprietary information to be compromised.
42. Abbott has invested in its systems and the protection of its data to reduce the risk of an invasion or interruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns to any of the systems on which Abbott relies and that could have a significant effect on Abbott's business.
43. AbbVie and Abbott entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements to govern the separation of AbbVie from Abbott and the relationship between the two companies going forward. These arrangements could lead to disputes between Abbott and AbbVie over Abbott's rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations. The separation and distribution agreement also provides for, among other things, indemnification obligations designed to make AbbVie financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after AbbVie's separation from Abbott, as well as those obligations of Abbott assumed by AbbVie pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement. It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between Abbott and AbbVie and require Abbott to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to AbbVie. Third parties could also seek to hold Abbott responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations. The indemnity rights Abbott has under the separation agreement may not be sufficient to protect Abbott. Even if Abbott is successful in obtaining indemnification, Abbott may have to bear losses temporarily. In addition, Abbott's indemnity obligations to AbbVie may be significant. These risks could negatively affect Abbott's results of operations.
44. Abbott received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the effect that, among other things, the separation and the distribution of AbbVie qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). In addition, Abbott received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Abbott and AbbVie regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not satisfied, Abbott and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the receipt by Abbott of the private letter ruling from the IRS and opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of Abbott or AbbVie after the separation. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Abbott and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.
45. On February 27, 2015, Abbott completed the disposition of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business and, in exchange, received 110,000,000 Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. In April 2015, Abbott sold 40,250,000 of these Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. Abbott currently owns 69,750,000 Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. As long as Abbott holds the remaining shares, Abbott will have a substantial undiversified equity investment in Mylan N.V. and, therefore, will be subject to the risk of changes in the market value of those shares.
46. Although Abbott's financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott's revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Abbott's profitability is affected by movement
47. of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott's assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks.
48. Abbott's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States make up approximately 70 percent of Abbott's net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott's international operations include:
49. differing local product preferences and product requirements;
50. trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;
51. difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations;
52. differing labor regulations;
53. potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;
54. political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;
55. price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;
56. inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates;
57. compulsory licensing or diminished protection of intellectual property; and
58. potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.
59. Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability.
60. Many other factors can affect Abbott's profitability and its financial condition, including:
61. changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, product labeling, source and use laws, and environmental laws;
62. differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles, and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;
63. changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott's equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott's employee benefit trusts;
64. changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott's employee benefit trusts;
65. changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters; widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups;
66. changes in Abbott's business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future;
67. changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners;
68. changes in credit markets or to Abbott's credit rating could impact Abbott's ability to obtain financing for its business operations or result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense; and
69. legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions.
70. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates, and projections. Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "forecasts," variations of these words, and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Certain factors, including but not limited to those identified under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K, may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations, estimates, projections, forecasts, and from past results. No assurance can be made that any expectation, estimate, or projection contained in a forward-looking statement will be achieved or will not be affected by the factors cited above or other future events. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as the result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.

20. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
21. In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott's actual results. Abbott's business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.
22. Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.
23. In the United States and other countries, Abbott's businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned "Regulation." To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors, Abbott's future revenues and operating income will be reduced.
24. Abbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and in substantial additional costs.
25. In addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott's products, and criminal prosecution. These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices
26. and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of Abbott's facilities while Abbott or Abbott's suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability and financial condition.
27. Abbott's industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott's business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition.
28. A number of the provisions of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 change access to health care products and services and establish new fees for the medical device industry. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking.
29. Many of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott's intellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property, Abbott's future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Litigation regarding Abbott's patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned "Legal Proceedings."
30. Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition.
31. To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.
32. Promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott's existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause Abbott's products to become obsolete, causing Abbott's revenues and operating results to suffer.
33. Abbott's products face intense competition from its competitors' products. Competitors' products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott's products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors' products.
34. The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability.
35. Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a
36. product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product's label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott's products.
37. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business and reputation and on Abbott's ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition.
38. Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott's collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott's receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems.
39. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of Abbott's information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Abbott's systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. Abbott has invested in its systems and the protection of its data to reduce the risk of an invasion or interruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns that could have a significant effect on Abbott's business.
40. AbbVie and Abbott entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements to govern the separation of AbbVie from Abbott and the relationship between the two companies going forward. These arrangements could lead to disputes between Abbott and AbbVie over Abbott's rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations. The separation and distribution agreement also provides for, among other things, indemnification obligations designed to make AbbVie financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after AbbVie's separation from Abbott, as well as those obligations of Abbott assumed by AbbVie pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement. It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between Abbott and AbbVie and require Abbott to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to AbbVie. Third parties could also seek to hold Abbott responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations. The indemnity rights Abbott has under the separation agreement may not be sufficient to protect Abbott. Even if Abbott is successful in obtaining indemnification, Abbott may have to bear losses temporarily. In addition, Abbott's
41. indemnity obligations to AbbVie may be significant. These risks could negatively affect Abbott's results of operations.
42. Abbott received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the effect that, among other things, the separation and the distribution of AbbVie qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). In addition, Abbott received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Abbott and AbbVie regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, Abbott and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the receipt by Abbott of the private letter ruling from the IRS and opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of Abbott or AbbVie after the separation. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Abbott and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.
43. On February 27, 2015, Abbott completed the disposition of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business and, in exchange, received 110,000,000 Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. As long as Abbott holds the shares, Abbott will have a substantial undiversified equity investment in Mylan and, therefore, will be subject to the risk of changes in the market value of those shares.
44. Although Abbott's financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott's revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Abbott's profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott's assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks.
45. Abbott's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States make up approximately 70 percent of Abbott's net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott's international operations include:
46. differing local product preferences and product requirements;
47. trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;
48. difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations;
49. differing labor regulations;
50. potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;
51. political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;
52. price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;
53. inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates;
54. compulsory licensing or diminished protection of intellectual property; and
55. potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.
56. Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability.
57. Many other factors can affect Abbott's profitability and its financial condition, including:
58. changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, product labeling, source and use laws, and environmental laws;
59. differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles, and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;
60. changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott's equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott's employee benefit trusts;
61. changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott's employee benefit trusts;
62. changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups;
63. changes in Abbott's business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future;
64. changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners;
65. changes in credit markets impacting Abbott's ability to obtain financing for its business operations; and
66. legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions.
67. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates, and projections. Words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "forecasts," variations of these words, and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Certain factors, including but not limited to those identified under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K, may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations, estimates, projections, forecasts, and from past results. No assurance can be made that any expectation, estimate, or projection contained in a forward-looking statement will be achieved or will not be affected by the factors cited above or other future events. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as the result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.

25. Kilitch Acquisition:
26. Kilitch Acquisition
27. On February 28, 2012, we acquired selected assets of Kilitch Drugs (India) Limited (“Kilitch”) pursuant to a Business Transfer Agreement (“BTA”) between our subsidiary, Akorn India Private Limited and Kilitch signed on October 6, 2011 (the “Kilitch Acquisition”). We paid approximately $60.1 million in cash at closing, which included consideration of $55.2 million and acquisition-related costs of $4.9 million. The primary assets acquired were Kilitch’s pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Paonta Sahib, Himachal Pradesh, India and its ongoing contract manufacturing business.

38. Zioptan Product Acquisition
39. On April 1, 2014, the Company acquired from Merck, Sharp and Dohme Corp. (“Merck”) the U.S. NDA rights to Zioptan®, a prescription ophthalmic eye drop indicated for reducing elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, from Merck, Sharp and Dohme Corp. (“Merck”). The total consideration at closing was $11.2 million. The purpose of the acquisition is to expand the Company’s product portfolio of branded prescription pharmaceuticals indicated for ophthalmology.
40. In connection with the acquisition, the Company entered into a master supply agreement with Merck whereby Merck will continue manufacturing Zioptan®for a transitional period.
41. Betimol Product Acquisition:
42. Betimol Product Acquisition
43. On January 2, 2014, the Company acquired the NDA rights to Betimol®, a prescription ophthalmic eye drop for the reduction of eye pressure in glaucoma patients, from Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., (“Santen”). The purpose of the Betimol Acquisition is to expand the Company’s product portfolio of branded prescription pharmaceuticals indicated for ophthalmology. The total consideration will be equal to 1.5 times the Company’s net sales of Betimol®in the first year following the acquisition. The Company paid a non-refundable amount of $7.5 million upon completing the acquisition and will pay any remaining amount 60 days following the first year post-acquisition. There is also a provision for a $2.0 million increase to the total consideration should net sales of Betimol®exceed a sizable threshold in any one of the first five years following the acquisition.
44. Upon completing the Betimol Acquisition, the Company entered into a supply agreement with Santen whereby Santen will continue manufacturing Betimol®for a transitional period.
45. Merck Products Acquisition:
46. On November 15, 2013, we acquired three ophthalmic products from Merck for $52.8 million in cash (the “Merck Products Acquisition”). The products acquired were:
47. AzaSite®– (azithromycin ophthalmic solution), a prescription sterile eye drop solution used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis,
48. Cosopt®– (dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate ophthalmic solution), a prescription sterile eye drop solution that is used to lower the pressure in the eye (intraocular pressure) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension; and
49. Cosopt®PF– a preservative-free prescription version of Cosopt®, supplied in sterile, single-use containers.
50. This acquisition expanded our line of prescription ophthalmic products to include additional branded products, and is expected to provide a platform to support future acquisitions and in-licensing of branded pharmaceuticals. Upon entering into the product acquisition agreement, we entered into supply agreements with Merck and a third party to ensure continued supply of the three products. The Merck Products Acquisition included our acquisition of a Merck subsidiary corporation, Inspire Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Inspire”), which was and continues to be the holder of the product rights to AzaSite®.
51. Lundbeck Products Acquisition:
52. On December 22, 2011, we acquired three NDAs from H. Lundbeck A/S (“Lundbeck”), a Denmark Corporation.On the date of closing of this acquisition (the “Lundbeck Acquisition”), we made an initial payment of $45.0 million and owed a subsequent milestone payment of $15.0 million in cash on the third anniversary of the closing date, which was paid in 2014. The acquired portfolio consists of Nembutal®,a Schedule II controlled drug, Diuril®and Cogentin®.In addition, we paid approximately $4.6 million for Lundbeck’s existing inventory of the three acquired products. This acquisition provided us with three branded, hospital injectables to add to our portfolio.
53. Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights.We consider the protection of our patents, trademarks and proprietary rights important to maintaining and growing our business. Through our acquisitions, we have increased the number and importance of trademarks related to our products and product lines. Through acquisitions, we also acquired rights to the trade names for the branded, prescription ophthalmic products AzaSite®, Betimol®, Cosopt®PF, and Zioptan®, respiratory product Xopenex®, as well as OTC eye care product TheraTears®. We are committed to maintaining and defending these trade names as they are important in supporting the success and growth of this business. In addition, we maintain and defend trademarks related to a number of internally-developed products, as well as others licensed from third parties.
54. Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights.
55. We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, patent protection in the United States and selected foreign countries where deemed appropriate and advantageous to us. The importance of these patents does not vary among our business segments. We currently have eleven patents, none of which expire within the next three years.
56. We also rely upon trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to maintain and develop our competitive position. We enter into confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees pursuant to which such employees agree to assign to us any inventions relating to our business made by them while in our employ. However, there can be no assurance that others may not acquire or independently develop similar technology or, if patents are not issued with respect to products arising from research, that we will be able to maintain information pertinent to such research as proprietary technology or trade secrets. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors —Our patents and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and processes” and “Third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent or delay us from manufacturing and selling some of our new products” for more information.
57. Employee Relations.As of December 31, 2014, we had 1,277 permanent, full-time employees and 21 part-time or temporary employees in the United States and 367 permanent and 216 contract or temporary employees working for our subsidiary in India. Of our full-time employees working in the U.S., 427 worked at our manufacturing facilities in Decatur, Illinois, 167 worked at our manufacturing facility in Somerset, New Jersey, 346 worked at our manufacturing facility in Amityville, New York, 55 were field-based salespersons, 13 were inside salespersons, 52 worked at our R&D facility in Vernon Hills, Illinois, 26 worked at our R&D facility in Warminster, Pennsylvania, 29 worked at R&D facilities acquired through the Hi-Tech acquisition, principally in Copiague, New York, and the remaining 162 worked in corporate support functions, including 124 at our principal corporate office in Lake Forest, Illinois, 13 in our other corporate office at Ann Arbor, Michigan, and 25 at our distribution facility in Gurnee, Illinois. We believe we have good relations with our employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.
58. Employee Relations.
59. Competition.The marketing and manufacturing of pharmaceutical products is highly competitive, with many established manufacturers, suppliers and distributors actively engaged in all phases of the business. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources, including greater sales volume, larger sales forces and greater manufacturing capacity. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — “Our industry is very competitive. Additionally, changes in technology could render our products obsolete” for more information.
60. Competition.
61. The companies that compete with our Prescription Pharmaceuticals segment include Actavis plc., Apotex Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Fresenius Kabi AG, Hikma Pharmaceuticals plc., Hospira Inc., Novartis International AG, Perrigo Company plc., Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Teva Pharmaceutical industries Ltd., and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., among others. The Prescription Pharmaceuticals segment competes primarily on the basis of price and service.
62. The companies that compete with our Consumer Health segment include both generic and name brand companies such as Actavis plc., Johnson & Johnson, Perrigo Company plc., Pfizer Inc., and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., among others. The Consumer Health segment competes primarily on the basis of price and service.
63. Suppliers and Customers.We require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for ourselves and for the third parties with which we have contracted. The principal components of our products are active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials. Many of these components are available from only a single source and, in the case of many of our ANDAs and NDAs, only one supplier of raw materials has been identified. Because FDA approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications, FDA approval of any new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier. The qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts. If for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products, we may not be able to manufacture our products as planned. In addition, certain of the pharmaceutical products that we market are manufactured by third parties that serve as our only supplier of those products. Any delays or failure of a contract manufacturing partner to supply finished goods timely or in adequate volume could impede our marketing of those products.
64. Suppliers and Customers.
65. No supplier represented 10% or more of our purchases in 2014, 2013 or 2012. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source” for more information.
66. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, a high percentage of our sales were to the three large wholesale drug distributors noted below. These three wholesale drug distributors account for a large portion of our gross sales, net revenues and accounts receivable in both of our segments. The three large wholesale drug distributors are:
67. AmerisourceBergen Corporation (“Amerisource”);
68. Cardinal Health, Inc. (“Cardinal”); and
69. McKesson Corporation (“McKesson”).
70. On a combined basis, these three wholesale drug distributors accounted for approximately 77% of our total gross sales and 61% of our net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2014, and 86% of our gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014. The difference between gross sales and net revenue is that gross sales is calculated before allowances for chargebacks, rebates, promotions and product returns (See “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — “Critical Accounting Policies” for more information).
71. The table below presents the percentages of our total gross sales, net revenue and gross trade accounts receivable attributed to each of these three wholesale drug distributors as of and for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively:
72. Amerisource
73. Combined Total
74. Amerisource, Cardinal and McKesson are key distributors of our products, as well as a broad range of health care products for many other companies. None of these distributors is an end user of our products. Generally speaking, if sales to any one of these distributors were to diminish or cease, we believe that the end users of our products would likely find little difficulty obtaining our products either directly from us or from another distributor. However, the loss of one or more of these distributors, together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users, could have a material negative impact on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, Amerisouce, Cardinal and McKesson have recently entered into strategic alliances with Walgreens Company (now Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.), CVS Health Corporation and Rite Aid Corporation, respectively. Since Walgreens, CVS Health and Rite-Aid are customers for several of our products, the loss of our distributor relationship with any of the three large wholesalers could result in a reduction to our revenues.
75. We consider our business relationships with Amerisource, Cardinal and McKesson to be in good standing and we currently have fee for services contracts with each of them. However, a change in purchasing patterns, a decrease in inventory levels, an increase in returns of our products, delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more of these distributors could have a material negative impact on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 1A “Risk Factors –We depend on a small number of distributors, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect” for more information.
76. Backorders.As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $19.2 million of products on backorder as compared to approximately $3.9 million of backorders as of December 31, 2013. We anticipate filling all open backorders during 2015.
77. Backorders.
78. Government Regulation.Pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies, including the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), the FTC and other federal, state and local agencies. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”), the Controlled Substance Act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage and promotion of products that we manufacture and market. The FDA inspects drug manufacturers and storage facilities to determine compliance with its current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations, non-compliance with which can result in fines, recall and seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to approve NDAs and ANDAs and criminal prosecution. The FDA also has the authority to revoke approval of drug products.
79. Government Regulation.
80. FDA approval is required before any application drug product can be manufactured and marketed. New drugs require the application filing of an NDA, including clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug. Generic drugs, which are equivalents of existing, off-patent brand name drugs, require the application filing of an ANDA. An ANDA does not, for the most part, require clinical studies since safety and efficacy have already been demonstrated by the product originator. However, the ANDA must, for example, provide data demonstrating the equivalency of the generic formulation in terms of bioavailability. The time required by the FDA to review and approve NDAs and ANDAs is variable and, to a large extent, beyond our control.
81. We are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and the DEA. Throughout the five year period ended December 31, 2014, there have been no product interruptions associated with regulatory inspection or related review activities. The most recent inspections conducted during April and May of 2014 at our Somerset, New Jersey facility and May and June of 2014 at our Decatur, Illinois facility resulted in no regulatory actions. The June 2014 FDA inspection of the Akorn India operation also resulted in no regulatory actions, and site status is pending confirmation from FDA.
82. DEA Regulation.We also manufacture and distribute several controlled-drug substances, the distribution and handling of which are regulated by the DEA. Failure to comply with DEA regulations can result in fines or seizure of product. There were no DEA citations issued to us in 2014, 2013, or 2012.
83. DEA Regulation.
84. Environment. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect from compliance with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
85. Environment
86. Foreign Sales. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, approximately $16.6 million, $27.3 million, and $29.4 million of our net revenue, respectively, was related to sales to customers in foreign countries. The decline in foreign revenues in comparison to 2013 is primarily the result of reduced sales generated by AIPL, our subsidiary in India. Of our total foreign sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, $7.2 million, $15.8 million and $16.7 million, respectively, were generated by AIPL, which exclusively sells product to customers in India and other unregulated world markets. The declining revenue generated by AIPL through the respective periods is principally the result of the Company’s decision to reduce revenues associated with comparatively low-margin contract manufacturing to focus on achieving U.S. FDA site approval. The Company’s worldwide business is subject to risks of currency fluctuations, governmental actions and other governmental proceedings abroad. The Company does not regard these risks as a deterrent to further expansion of its operations abroad. However, the Company closely reviews its methods of operations and seeks to adopt strategies responsive to changing economic and political conditions.
87. Foreign Sales
88. Seasonality and other Cyclical Sales Fluctuations. The majority of our products do not experience significant seasonality. We do market certain prescription pharmaceutical and consumer health products for the treatment of allergies that typically generate higher sales volume in the warmer months as well as cough and cold products which typically generate higher sales volume in the colder months, but these products do not materially impact our overall sales trends. Additionally, we market various antidote products through our Prescription Pharmaceuticals segment, the sales of which are largely timed to the expiration of existing stock held by our ongoing customers. In addition, since the fourth quarter of 2012 we have been a distributor of Tetanus and Diphtheria (“Td”) vaccines, which tends to generate higher sales in spring through fall.
89. Seasonality and other Cyclical Sales Fluctuations
90. Government Contracts. We maintain distribution contracts with the U.S. Federal Government (“Government”), including Veteran’s Administration among others. A number of these contracts allow the Government to terminate upon written notice. We do not believe that any single termination is likely or would be material to our operations.
91. Government Contracts
92. Available Information. We file annual, quarterly and special reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Materials filed with the SEC can be read and copied at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at100 FStreet,NE, Washington, DC20549.Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet web site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Our filings are available to the public at the website maintained by the SEC,http://www.sec.gov. We also make available, free of charge, through our web site atwww.akorn.com, our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information contained on our web site is not a part of this document.

96. Risk Factors.
97. An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider each of the risks described below before purchasing shares of our common stock. The risk factors set forth below are not the only risks that may affect our business. Our business could also be affected by additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could materially suffer. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
98. Our growth and profitability is dependent on our ability to complete strategic acquisitions or to identify, acquire or develop, new products to market and distribute.
99. We continue to seek growth opportunities, either by completing strategic acquisitions or by developing and introducing new pharmaceutical products. Continued improvement in our financial performance is dependent on our ability to introduce new products on an ongoing basis, whether developed internally or by third party partners, or acquired from other companies. Any delays or an inability to successfully identify suitable acquisition targets, or acquire or develop, and market and distribute new products, or acquisition or development of new products that do not yield sufficient margins, may result in adverse financial consequences to our business.
100. We may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions and we may face difficulties in integrating them, which could adversely affect our operating results, increase costs and place a significant strain on our management.
101. If we fail to manage the integration of our domestic and international acquisitions and achieve expected synergies and revenue growth, our business could be disrupted and our operating results could be negatively impacted. The operating success of both our domestic and international acquisitions involves the integration of products, processes and personnel into our existing model. In addition, the integration of international acquisitions requires both establishing and training a local management team and overseeing the operations remotely, and can involve cultural, monetary and systems challenges. Our personnel, systems, procedures, or controls may not be adequate to support both our ongoing business and the acquired businesses. If any newly-acquired businesses or assets require a disproportionate share of our resources and management’s attention, our overall financial results may suffer.
102. Failure to obtain regulatory certification of our manufacturing facility in India for production of pharmaceutical products for export to the United States, as well as other regulated world markets, could impair our ability to grow and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
103. We operate a manufacturing campus in Paonta Sahib, India, which we acquired through a business combination in 2012. The manufacturing units within this campus were built to the standards of regulated markets, including the United States, but they are not currently approved by the FDA to manufacture products for export to the United States. It is our intention to obtain certification from the FDA and other regulatory authorities to allow this facility to manufacture products for export to the United States and other regulated world markets. Obtaining such certification in a timely manner is critical to our sustaining our growth. An inability to obtain or maintain such certification could restrict our ability to achieve our growth objectives, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
104. Further, our operations in India may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy in India, including changes in exchange rates and controls, interest rates and taxation policies; any reversal of India’s recent economic liberalization and deregulation policies; as well as social stability and political, economic or diplomatic developments affecting India in the future. In addition, India is known to have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in some circumstances, anti-bribery laws may conflict with some local customs and practices. As a result of our internal policies aimed at full compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and similar anti-bribery laws, we may be at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are not subject to, or do not comply with, such laws.
105. Our indebtedness reduces our financial and operating flexibility.
106. We have entered into various credit arrangements to fund certain of our operations and activities, principally business combinations. During the year ended December 31, 2014 we significantly increased our debt obligations through new term loans. As of December 31, 2014, our debt includes a $600.0 million Existing Term Loan Facility, a $445.0 million Incremental Term Loan Facility, and $87.5 million principal balance in our Convertible Senior Notes due 2016 (the “Notes”) and we also have available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities (See “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition and Liquidity” for definitions and descriptions of our Existing Term Loan Facility, Incremental Term Loan Facility and Notes and our credit facilities).. A high level of indebtedness subjects us to a number of adverse risks. In particular, a significant portion of our current indebtedness has variable interest terms meaning we are subject to the risks associated with higher interest rates, and moreover, a high level of indebtedness may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. In addition, our current debt arrangements require that we devote a significant portion of our cash flows to service amounts outstanding under those debt arrangements. We also are subject to various covenants with respect to our indebtedness, including the obligation to meet certain defined financial ratios and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders is restricted. Further, our indebtedness may restrict or otherwise impair our ability to raise additional capital through other debt financing, which could restrict our ability to grow our business. Our ability to meet our debt obligations, to comply with all required covenants, and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient funds on hand to pay our debt when due, we may be required to seek a waiver or amendment from our lenders, refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets or sell additional shares of securities. We may not be able to complete such transactions on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our failure to generate sufficient funds to pay our debts or to undertake any of these actions successfully could result in a default on our debt obligations, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
107. We may not generate cash flow sufficient to pay interest and make required principal repayments on our Term Loans.
108. On April 17, 2014, upon completing the Hi-Tech Acquisition, we entered into a $600.0 million term loan with certain other lenders with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acting as the administrative agent (the “Existing Term Loan”) and on August 12, 2014, upon completing the VersaPharm Acquisition, we entered into a $445.0 million term loan with certain other lenders with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acting as the administrative agent (the “Incremental Term Loan”). These term loans significantly increased our debt obligations. The Existing Term Loan and Incremental Term Loan each bear interest at a variable rate at a margin above prime or LIBOR, at our election. In addition to our interest obligation, we are required to repay 0.25% of the principal balance quarterly, beginning with the second and first full quarter, respectively after entering into the loan agreements. The remaining outstanding balance under each of the Existing Term Loan and the Incremental Term Loan will be due and payable on April 17, 2021. If we do not generate sufficient operating cash flows to fund these payments or obtain additional funding from external sources at acceptable terms, we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy our principal and interest payment obligations when those obligations are due, which would place us into default under the terms of the Existing Term Loan and the Incremental Term Loan. Such default would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our borrowings are secured by all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. If the Company defaults on its obligations under the Existing Term Loan or the Incremental Term Loans, the lenders may be able to foreclose upon its security interest and otherwise be entitled to obtain or control Company assets.
109. Our growth depends on our ability to timely develop and successfully market new pharmaceutical products.
110. Our strategy for growth is dependent upon our ability to develop products that can be promoted through current marketing and distributions channels and, when appropriate, the enhancement of such marketing and distribution channels. We may fail to meet our anticipated time schedule for the filing of ANDAs and NDAs or may decide not to pursue ANDAs or NDAs that we have already submitted or anticipate submitting. Our internal development of new pharmaceutical products is dependent upon the research and development capabilities of our personnel and our strategic business alliance infrastructure. There can be no assurance that we or our strategic business alliance partners will successfully develop new pharmaceutical products or, if developed, that we will successfully commercialize these new pharmaceutical products. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will receive all necessary FDA approvals or that such approvals will not involve delays, which may adversely affect the commercial success of our products. Our failure to develop new products or to receive FDA approval of ANDAs or NDAs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if successfully developed and launched, no assurance can be given as to the actual size of the market for any product or the level of profitability and sales of the product.
111. Generic and off-patent pharmaceuticalproducts are particularly susceptible to competition, substitutionpolicies and reimbursement policies.
112. Generic and off-patent pharmaceutical
113. products are particularly susceptible to competition, substitution
114. policies and reimbursement policies.
115. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify suitable branded pharmaceutical products to target for development of generic equivalents, determine or anticipate the dates when these branded pharmaceuticals are expected to come off patent, and time our product development activities accordingly so that we will be ready to manufacture and market our generic equivalent products at the most advantageous times. Generic pharmaceuticals must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals, even though these equivalent pharmaceuticals are sold at prices that are significantly lower than branded pharmaceuticals. Generic substitution is regulated by the federal and state governments, as is reimbursement for generic drug dispensing. There can be no assurance that substitution will be permitted for newly approved generic drugs or that such products will be subject to government reimbursement. In addition, generic products developed by competing drug companies may render our generic products noncompetitive or obsolete, or may glut the market with competing products resulting in a reduction in sale price or market share for the generic products we sell. There can be no assurance that we will be able to consistently bring generic pharmaceutical products to market quickly and efficiently in the future. An increase in competition in the sale of generic pharmaceutical products or our failure to bring such products to market before our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
116. Further, there is no proprietary protection for most of the branded pharmaceutical products that either we or other pharmaceutical companies sell. In addition, governmental and cost-containment pressures regarding the dispensing of generic equivalents will likely result in generic substitution and competition generally for our branded pharmaceutical products. We attempt to mitigate the effect of this substitution through, among other things, creation of strong brand-name recognition and product-line extensions for our branded pharmaceutical products, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.
117. We are subject to extensive government regulations that increase our costs, subject us to various obligations andcould subject us to fines, prevent us from selling our products or prevent usfrom operating our facilities.
118. We are subject to extensive government regulations that increase our costs, subject us to various obligations and
119. could subject us to fines, prevent us from selling our products or prevent us
120. from operating our facilities.
121. Various federal and state government agencies regulate virtually all aspects of our business. The development, testing, manufacturing, processing, quality, safety, efficacy, packaging, labeling, record keeping, distribution, storage and advertising of our products, and disposal of waste products arising from such activities, are subject to regulation by the FDA, DEA, FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. Similar state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over these activities. Noncompliance with applicable United States and/or state or local regulatory requirements can result in fines, injunctions, penalties, mandatory recalls or seizures, suspensions of production, recommendations by the FDA against governmental contracts and criminal prosecution. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. New, modified and additional regulations, statutes or legal interpretation, if any, could, among other things, require changes to manufacturing methods, expanded or different labeling, recall, replacement or discontinuation of certain products, additional record keeping procedures and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and additional scientific substantiation. Such changes or new legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain of the regulatory risks that we are subject to are outlined below.
122. We are subject to regulation by the FDA.All pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us, are subject to regulation by the FDA under the authority of the FDC Act. Under the FDC Act, the federal government has extensive administrative and judicial enforcement authority over the activities of finished drug product manufacturers to ensure compliance with FDA regulations. This authority includes, but is not limited to, the authority to initiate judicial action to seize unapproved or non-complying products, to enjoin non-complying activities, to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with cGMP, to recall products, to seek civil and monetary penalties and to criminally prosecute violators. Other enforcement activities include refusal to approve product applications, withdrawal of previously approved applications or prohibition on marketing of certain grandfathered products. Any such enforcement activities, especially the restriction or prohibition on sales of products we market or the halting of our manufacturing operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FDA or other government agencies having regulatory authority over pharmaceutical products may request us to voluntarily or involuntarily conduct product recalls due to disputed labeling claims, manufacturing issues, quality defects or for other reasons. Restriction or prohibition on sales, halting of manufacturing operations, recalls of our pharmaceutical products or other enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, such actions, in certain circumstances, may constitute an event of default under the terms of our various financing arrangements.
123. We are subject to regulation by the FDA.
124. We must obtain approval from the FDA for each pharmaceutical product thatwe market.The FDA approval process is typically lengthy, and approval is never certain. Our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval. Even if the FDA or another regulatory agency approves a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product, may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell and distribute a product or may require post-marketing studies or impose other post-marketing obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on marketability and profitability of the new products.

Our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval. Even if the FDA or another regulatory agency approves a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product, may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell and distribute a product or may require post-marketing studies or impose other post-marketing obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on marketability and profitability of the new products.
127. We and our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection bythe FDA to assure regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing,distribution, and promotion of pharmaceutical products.The FDA imposes stringent mandatory requirements on the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products to ensure their safety and efficacy. The FDA also regulates drug labeling and the advertising of prescription drugs. A finding by a governmental agency or court that we are not in compliance with FDA requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
128. We and our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by
129. the FDA to assure regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing,
130. distribution, and promotion of pharmaceutical products.
131. If the FDA changes its regulatory position, it could force us to delay orsuspend our manufacturing, distribution or sales of certain products.FDA interpretations of existing or pending regulations and standards may change over time with the advancement of associated technologies, industry trends, and/or prevailing scientific rationale. If the FDA changes its regulatory position due to such factors, it could result in delay or suspension of the manufacturing, distribution or sales of certain of our products. In addition, modifications or enhancements of approved products are in many circumstances subject to additional FDA approvals which may or may not be granted and which may be subject to a lengthy application process. Any change in the FDA’s enforcement policy or any decision by the FDA to require an approved NDA or ANDA for one of our products not currently subject to the approved NDA or ANDA requirements or any delay in the FDA approving an NDA or ANDA for one of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
132. If the FDA changes its regulatory position, it could force us to delay or
133. suspend our manufacturing, distribution or sales of certain products.
134. We are subject to extensive DEA regulation, which could result in ourbeing fined or otherwise penalized.We also manufacture and sell drugs which are “controlled substances” as defined in the Federal Controlled Substances Act and similar state laws, which impose, among other things, certain licensing, security and record keeping requirements administered by the DEA and similar state agencies, as well as quotas for the manufacture, purchase and sale of controlled substances. The DEA could limit or reduce the amount of controlled substances which we are permitted to manufacture and market or issue fines and penalties against us for purported non-compliance with DEA regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
135. We are subject to extensive DEA regulation, which could result in our
136. being fined or otherwise penalized.
137. We may be subject to governmental demands to continue production and marketing of certain products which we would otherwise not continue. We manufacture and sell drugs which include those identified as life-saving, essential or critical by the World Health Organization and other generic and branded drugs whose production or sale by the Company could be required by various governments or governmental agencies irrespective of the financial effects. Required production or sale of these products which we would otherwise not continue could affect our financial and operating flexibility.
138. We may be subject to governmental demands to continue production and marketing of certain products which we would otherwise not continue
139. We are subject to the Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act ("DSCSA") that requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period.Compliance with DSCSA and future U.S. federal or state electronic pedigree requirements may increase the Company's operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens.
140. We are subject to the Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act ("DSCSA") that requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period.
141. We depend on a small number of distributors, the loss of any of which couldhave a material adverse effect.
142. We depend on a small number of distributors, the loss of any of which could
143. have a material adverse effect.
144. A small number of large wholesale drug distributors account for a significant portion of our gross sales, net revenues and accounts receivable. The following three wholesalers – Amerisource, Cardinal and McKesson – accounted for approximately 77% of total gross sales and 61% of total net revenues in 2014, and 86% of gross trade receivables as of December 31, 2014. In addition to acting as distributors of our products, these three companies also distribute a broad range of health care products on behalf of many other companies. The loss of our relationship with one or more of these wholesalers, together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users, could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations. In particular, Amerisource, Cardinal and McKesson have entered into strategic drug purchasing alliances with Walgreens Company (now Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.), CVS Health Corporation and Rite Aid Corporation, respectively. The chain drugstores are customers for a number of our products. Therefore, the loss of our relationship with any of the three large wholesalers would likely result in the loss of revenue from sales to these drugstore chains. A change in purchasing patterns or inventory levels, an increase in returns of our products, penalties assessed against us for failure to supply or failure to maintain service levels, delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more of these distributors also could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.
145. Sales of our products may be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our customer base.
146. In addition to our sales to wholesale drug distributors detailed above, a significant proportion of our sales are made to relatively few retail drug chains and managed care purchasing organizations. These customers are continuing to undergo significant consolidation. Such consolidation has provided and may continue to provide them with additional purchasing leverage, and consequently may increase the pricing pressures that we face. Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies, and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions, enable those groups to extract price discounts on our products.
147. Our net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may also be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of retail chains, major distributors and other trade buyers, whether resulting from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler buying decisions or other factors. In addition, since such a significant portion of our revenues is derived from relatively few customers, any financial difficulties experienced by a single customer, or any delay in receiving payments from a single customer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
148. We may not generate cash flow sufficient to pay interest on our outstanding convertible senior notes or repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change.
149. In June 2011, we issued $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% Convertible Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2014, $87.5 million principal balance of the Notes remains outstanding. The Notes require us to make semi-annual coupon interest payments of $2.1 million on June 1 and December 1 of each year until the Notes mature on June 1, 2016. If we do not generate sufficient operating cash flows to fund these payments or obtain additional funding from external sources at acceptable terms, we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy our interest payment obligations when those obligations are due which would place us in default under the Indenture (as defined below). If a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase their Notes. If we fail to repurchase the Notes when required, we will be in default under the Indenture.
150. We may need to obtain additional capital to continue to grow our business.
151. We may require additional funds in order to materially grow our business. We require substantial liquidity to implement long-term cost savings and productivity improvement plans, continue capital spending to improve our manufacturing facilities to increase capacity and support product development programs, meet scheduled term debt and lease maturities, to effect acquisitions and to run our normal business operations. We may seek additional funds through public and private financing, including equity and debt offerings. However, adequate funds through the financial markets or from other sources may not be available to us when needed or on favorable terms. Without sufficient additional capital funding, we may be required to delay, scale back or abandon some or all of our product development, manufacturing, acquisition, licensing and marketing initiatives, or operations. Further, such additional financing, if obtained, may require the granting of rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the common stock and result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of the common stockholders and could include covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to operate or expand our business in a manner that we deem to be in our best interest.
152. Our industry is very competitive. Additionally, changes in technology couldrender our products obsolete.
153. Our industry is very competitive. Additionally, changes in technology could
154. render our products obsolete.
155. We face significant competition from other pharmaceutical companies, including major pharmaceutical companies with financial resources substantially greater than ours, in developing, acquiring, manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. The selling prices of pharmaceutical products typically decline as competition increases. Further, other products now in use, under development or acquired by other pharmaceutical companies, may be more effective or offered at lower prices than our current or future products. The industry is characterized by rapid technological change that may render our products obsolete, and competitors may develop their products more rapidly than we can. Competitors may also be able to complete the regulatory process sooner, and therefore, may begin to market their products in advance of ours. We believe that competition in sales of our products is based primarily on price, service and technical capabilities. There can be no assurance that: (i) we will be able to develop or acquire commercially attractive pharmaceutical products; (ii) additional competitors will not enter the market; (iii) our existing products will not be rendered obsolete by the introduction or switch to generic of competing products; or (iv) competition from other pharmaceutical companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
156. Unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business.
157. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by volatile general economic conditions and, or, business environment. If equity and credit market conditions prove unfavorable, we may have difficulty obtaining desired debt or equity financing, or obtaining such financing may be more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive. A prolonged or profound economic downturn could result in adverse changes to product reimbursement, pricing or sales levels, which would harm our operating results. There is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive difficult economic times, which would directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon development plans. Moreover, our stock price may decline due to the volatility of the stock market and general economic conditions.
158. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if we otherwise fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, timely file our periodic reports, maintain our reporting status or prevent fraud.
159. In connection with our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, we concluded there were certain material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to identified control deficiencies in respect of completeness and accuracy of data used in the determination of significant estimates and accounting transactions and the process in place to support the accurate and timely reporting of financial results and disclosures. We also concluded that, as of December 31, 2014, we had inadequate controls in place to prevent or detect material errors in the financial statements of acquired subsidiaries, and an error was identified related to the chargeback reserve of Hi-Tech recognized at the acquisition date which requires the restatement of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter and six-months ended June 30, 2014 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Note that we excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, Hi-Tech’s and VersaPharm’s internal control over financial reporting. Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected or corrected on a timely basis.
160. We are working to remediate the material weaknesses. With respect to validation of the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the determination of significant estimates and accounting transactions, management intends to:
161. Conduct manual data validation procedures on certain reports related to gross to net adjustments and inventory.
162. Enhance the design of management review controls to increase the level of precision.
163. Establish a dedicated revenue accounting team focused primarily on significant gross to net revenue adjustments.
164. Ensure all systems relied upon in the financial reporting process are subject to Information Technology General Controls (ITGCs) which are intended to prevent system changes that could affect the completeness and accuracy of the data used.
165. With respect to timely and accurate filing of our financial results, management intends to:
166. Undertake a financial close process improvement project utilizing external consultants to identify efficiencies and enhance reporting capabilities as well as opportunities to reduce the incidence of errors.
167. Implement more robust accounting policies and work with consultants to streamline close activities and implement best practices.
168. Enhance communications between the accounting and tax groups to ensure timely and accurate tax considerations.
169. Deploy additional internal and/or external tax resources to allow for additional levels of management review controls.
170. With respect to the financial statement of acquired subsidiaries, management intends to:
171. Evaluate the control environment of target acquisitions and acquired entities in a timely fashion to facilitate improvements in the subsidiary’s control environment within the year of acquisition.
172. Develop controls specifically designed to identify material errors within subsidiary financial statements.
173. Drive consistency in internal controls across all Akorn entities.
174. Deploy appropriate personnel with public company accounting experience at the subsidiary level, as needed.
175. Additionally, we plan on creating a new position to oversee accounting systems, administer and monitor ITGCs, coordinate between the Company’s accounting and information technology departments, identify opportunities to streamline and improve processes through greater automation, and plan to add personnel with internal controls and process improvement capabilities within the accounting function. Responsibilities will include designing internal controls and ensuring compliance, implementing global accounting policies and procedures, and implementing process improvements.
176. The actions that we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as audit committee oversight.
177. Although we plan to complete this remediation as quickly as possible, we cannot at this time estimate how long it will take, and our initiatives may not prove to be successful in remediating this material weakness. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to further restate our financial results.
178. Our management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. The existence of internal control material weaknesses may result in current and potential stockholders losing confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business, the market price of our common stock, and our ability to retain our current, or obtain new, alliance and collaboration agreements’ partners.
179. In addition, the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may affect our ability to timely file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The inability to timely file periodic reports could result in the SEC revoking the registration of our common stock, which would prohibit us from listing or having our stock quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market or any other stock exchange. This would have an adverse effect on our business and stock price by limiting the publicly available information regarding us and greatly reducing the ability of our stockholders to sell or trade our common stock.
180. Our revenues depend on sale of products manufactured by third parties, which wecannot control.
181. Our revenues depend on sale of products manufactured by third parties, which we
182. cannot control.
183. We rely in part on external third parties to manufacture certain of the products we sell. Currently, this risk is limited to several of our products. However, we expect this risk to become more significant as we receive approvals for new products to be manufactured through our strategic partnerships and as we seek additional growth opportunities beyond the capacity and capabilities of our current manufacturing facilities. If we are unable to obtain or retain third-party manufacturers for these products on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to distribute such products as planned. Further, no assurance can be given that the manufacturers we use will be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of our products to meet our needs or that the products supplied to us will meet our specifications. Any delays or difficulties with third-party manufacturers could adversely affect the marketing and distribution of certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
184. Many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from asingle source.
185. Many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a
186. single source.
187. We require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for ourselves and for third parties with which we have contracted. Many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source and interruptions in the supply of these raw materials and components could disrupt our manufacturing of specific products and cause our sales and profitability to decline. Further, in the case of many of our ANDAs and NDAs, only one supplier of raw materials has been identified. Because FDA approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications, FDA approval of any new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier. The qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts. If for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products, we may not be able to manufacture our products as planned, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
188. Any failure to comply with the complex reporting and payment obligations under Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs may result in litigation or sanctions.
189. We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims, marketing and pricing laws. We are also subject to Medicaid and other government reporting and payment obligations that are highly complex and somewhat ambiguous. Violations of these laws and reporting obligations are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The recent healthcare reform legislation made several changes to the federal anti-kickback statute, false claims laws, and health care fraud statute such as increasing penalties and making it easier for the government to bring sanctions against pharmaceutical companies. If our past, present or future operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or other similar governmental regulations, we may be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the violation which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and negatively impact our financial results. Further, if there is a change in laws, regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations, we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.
190. Exercise of options, granting of restricted shares, or issuance of shares pursuant to our convertible debt, may have a substantial dilutive effect on ourcommon stock.
191. Exercise of options, granting of restricted shares, or issuance of shares pursuant to our convertible debt, may have a substantial dilutive effect on our
192. common stock.
193. If the price per share of our common stock at the time of exercise of any stock options is in excess of the various exercise prices of such options, exercise of such options would have a dilutive effect on our common stock. As of December 31, 2014, holders of our outstanding options would receive 6.4 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $11.44 per share.
194. Our earnings per share will also be diluted if the average closing price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price (currently $8.76 per share) on our convertible Notes. The Notes became convertible for the quarter ending on June 30, 2012 as a result of the Company’s stock trading at or above the required price of $11.39 per share for 20 of the last 30 trading days in the quarter ended March 31, 2012 and have remained convertible for each successive quarter as a result of meeting the trading price requirement at the end of each prior quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately $32.5 million of the Notes were converted by the holders while $87.5 million remain available for conversion. If the Notes are surrendered for conversion, we have the option of satisfying all or a portion of our obligation in shares of our common stock, which could result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common shareholders.
195. We have grown at a very rapid pace. Our inability to effectively manage or support this growth may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.
196. We have grown very rapidly over the past year as a result of several acquisitions and increasing sales, and additional growth through acquisitions is possible in the future. This growth has put significant demands on our processes, systems, and people. We have made and expect to make further investments in additional personnel, systems, and internal control processes to help manage our growth. Attracting, retaining and motivating key employees in various departments and locations to support our growth are critical to our business, and competition for these people can be significant. If we are unable to hire and/or retain qualified employees and/or if we do not effectively invest in systems and processes to manage and support our rapid growth and the challenges and difficulties associated with managing a larger, more complex business, and/or if we cannot effectively manage and integrate our increasingly diverse and global platform, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flow, and the market value of our common stock could decline.
197. Changes in healthcare law and policy changes may adversely affect our business.
198. In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Healthcare Act”). This health care reform legislation is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. As examples, the current legislation include measures that would (i) significantly increase Medicaid rebates through both the expansion of the program and significant increases in rebates; (ii) substantially expand the Public Health System (340B) program to allow other entities to purchase prescription drugs at substantial discounts; (iii) extend the Medicaid rebate rate to a significant portion of Managed Medicaid enrollees; (iv) assess a 50% rebate on Medicaid Part D spending in the coverage gap for branded and authorized generic prescription drugs; and (v) levy an excise tax on certain drug and device manufacturers.
199. While the aforementioned healthcare reform legislation may increase the number of patients who have insurance coverage for our products, such insurance mandate did not commence until January 2014, and the healthcare reform legislation also restructured and reduced payments to Medicare managed care plans and reduces reimbursements to many third-party payers. Accordingly, the timing on the insurance mandate, the change in the Medicaid rebate levels, the additional fees imposed on us to the extent we market branded drugs, other compliance obligations, and the reduced reimbursement levels to institutional customers may result in a loss of revenue and could adversely affect our business. While we will not know the full effects of this health care reform legislation until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law and the new law has been fully implemented, it appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and to increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
200. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Healthcare Act was enacted. Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011 which, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress, including a committee tasked with proposing legislation to reduce the federal deficit. The committee did not act, which triggered the legislation's automatic reduction to government programs. Because of this legislation, Medicare reimbursement to providers was reduced overall by 2% beginning April 1, 2013. This, and other new laws, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.
201. The sales of our products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations including PBMs and other health care-related organizations. We expect both federal and state governments in the U.S. and foreign governments to continue to propose and pass new legislation, rules and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Existing regulations that affect the price of pharmaceutical and other medical products may also change before any of our products are approved for marketing. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product we develop in the future. In addition, PBMs and other third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products. Our products may not be considered cost effective, or adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a return on our investments. All of these may harm our ability to market our products and generate profits.
202. We have entered into several strategic business alliances that may not resultin marketable products.
203. We have entered into several strategic business alliances that may not result
204. in marketable products.
205. We have entered into several strategic business alliances that have been formed to supply us with low cost finished dosage form products. We have entered into various purchase and supply agreements and license agreements that are all designed to provide finished dosage form products that can be marketed through our distribution pipeline. There can be no assurance that these agreements will result in additional FDA-approved ANDAs or NDAs, or that we will be able to market any such additional products at a profit. In addition, any clinical trial expenses that we may incur in connection with these strategic business alliances may negatively impact our financial results.
206. We may become involved in legal proceedings from time to time which may result in losses, damage to our business and reputation and place a strain on our internal resources.
207. In the ordinary course of our business, we may be involved in legal proceedings with both private parties and certain government agencies, including FDA. Litigation may result in verdicts against us, which may include significant monetary awards, judgments that certain of our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable and injunctions preventing the manufacture, marketing and sale of our products. If disputes are resolved unfavorably, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
208. Any litigation, whether or not successful, may damage our reputation. Furthermore, we are likely to incur substantial expense in defending these lawsuits and the time demands of such lawsuits could divert management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and interfere with our normal operations.
209. In the normal course of business, we periodically enter into employment agreements, legal settlements, and other agreements which incorporate indemnification provisions. We maintain insurance coverage which we believe will effectively mitigate our obligations under these indemnification provisions. However, should our obligation under an indemnification provision exceed our coverage or should coverage be denied, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
210. Third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent or delay us from manufacturing and selling some of our new products.
211. The manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical companies with patented brand products frequently sue companies that file applications to produce generic equivalents of their patented brand products for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, which may delay or prevent the entry of such generic products into the market. Generally, a generic drug may not be marketed until the applicable patent(s) on the brand name drug expire or are held to be not infringed, invalid, or unenforceable. When we or our development partners submit an ANDA to the FDA for approval of a generic drug, we and/or our development partners must certify either (i) that there is no patent listed by the FDA as covering the relevant brand product, (ii) that any patent listed as covering the brand product has expired, (iii) that the patent listed as covering the brand product will expire prior to the marketing of the generic product, in which case the ANDA will not be finally approved by the FDA until the expiration of such patent, or (iv) that any patent listed as covering the brand drug is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of the generic product for which the ANDA is submitted.
212. Under any circumstance in which an act of infringement is alleged to occur, there is a risk that a brand pharmaceutical company may sue us for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Also, competing pharmaceutical companies may file lawsuits against us or our strategic partners alleging patent infringement or may file declaratory judgment actions of non-infringement, invalidity, or unenforceability against us relating to our own patents. We have been sued for patent infringement related to several of our current ANDA filings and we anticipate that we will be sued once we file ANDAs for other products in our pipeline. Such litigation is often costly and time-consuming and could result in a substantial delay in, or prevent, the introduction and/or marketing of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
213. Although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to us on terms we believe to be acceptable.
214. Our patents and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products andprocesses.
215. Our patents and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and
216. The patent and proprietary rights position of competitors in the pharmaceutical industry generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and is the subject of much litigation. There can be no assurance that any patent applications or other proprietary rights, including licensed rights, relating to our potential products or processes will result in patents being issued or other proprietary rights secured, or that the resulting patents or proprietary rights, if any, will provide protection against competitors who: (i) successfully challenge our patents or proprietary rights; (ii) obtain patents or proprietary rights that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business; or (iii) are able to circumvent our patent or proprietary rights position. It is possible that other parties have conducted or are conducting research and could make discoveries of pharmaceutical formulations or processes that would precede any discoveries made by us, which could prevent us from obtaining patent or other protection for these discoveries or marketing products developed therefrom. Consequently, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop pharmaceutical products similar to or rendering obsolete those that we are planning to develop, or duplicate any of our products. Our inability to obtain patents for, or other proprietary rights in, our products and processes or the ability of competitors to circumvent or obsolete our patents or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, our inability to successfully defend our existing patents against Paragraph IV challenges by competing drug companies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
217. Further, the majority of the drug products that we market are generics, with essentially no patent or proprietary rights attached. While this fact allowed us the opportunity to develop or to purchase and obtain FDA approval to market our generic products, it also allows competing drug companies to do the same. Should multiple additional drug companies choose to develop and market the same generic products that we actively market, our profit margins could decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
218. The Chairman of our Board of Directors is subject to conflicts of interest, and through his stock ownership and position as Chairman has substantial influence over our business strategies and policies.
219. John N. Kapoor, Ph.D., the Chairman of our Board of Directors and a principal shareholder, is the President of EJ Financial Enterprises, Inc. (“EJ Financial”), a health care consulting investment company. EJ Financial is involved in the management of health care companies in various fields, and Dr. Kapoor is involved in various capacities with the management and operation of these companies. The John N. Kapoor Trust dated 9/20/89 (the “Kapoor Trust”), the beneficiary and sole trustee of which is Dr. Kapoor, is a principal shareholder of each of these companies. As a result, Dr. Kapoor does not devote his full time to our business. Although such companies do not currently compete directly with us, certain companies with which EJ Financial is involved are in the pharmaceutical business. Discoveries made by one or more of these companies could render our products less competitive or obsolete. Potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
220. As of December 31, 2014, Dr. Kapoor beneficially owns approximately 30% of our common stock. As a result, Dr. Kapoor can strongly influence, and potentially control, the outcome of our corporate actions, including the election of our directors and transactions involving a change of control. This concentrated control limits other shareholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, the Company may take actions that other shareholders do not view as beneficial. Further, decisions made by Dr. Kapoor with respect to his and his related parties’ ownership or trading of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and an adverse effect on our business.
221. We depend on key executive officers and must continue to attract and retain key personnel in order to compete successfully.
222. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key executive officers. The loss of one or more of our key executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
223. Further, our performance depends, to a large extent, on the continued service of our key research and development personnel, other technical employees, managers and sales personnel and our ability to continue to attract and retain such personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, particularly for highly motivated and experienced research and development and other technical personnel. We are facing increasing competition from companies with greater financial resources for such personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled personnel in the future, and the inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, and on our results of operations and financial condition.
224. We may implement product recalls and could be exposed to significant productliability claims; we may have to pay significant amounts to those harmed andmay suffer from adverse publicity as a result.
225. We may implement product recalls and could be exposed to significant product
226. liability claims; we may have to pay significant amounts to those harmed and
227. may suffer from adverse publicity as a result.
228. The manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk that our products, or items within our products, may prove to be defective and cause a health risk. In that event, we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority. We have recalled products in the past and, based on this experience, believe that the occurrence of a recall could result in significant costs to us, potential disruptions in the supply of our products to our customers and adverse publicity, all of which could harm our ability to market our products.
229. Although we are not currently subject to any material product liability proceedings, we may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future. Even meritless claims could subject us to adverse publicity, hinder us from securing insurance coverage in the future and require us to incur significant legal fees and divert the attention of the key employees from running our business. Successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
230. We currently have product liability insurance in the amount of $20,000,000 for aggregate annual claims with a $250,000 deductible per incident and a $1,250,000 aggregate annual deductible. However, there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to fully cover potential claims. Additionally, there can be no assurance that adequate insurance coverage will be available in the future at acceptable costs, if at all, or that a product liability claim would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
231. The FDA may require us to stop marketing certain grandfathered drugs.
232. We market several generic prescription products which do not have formal FDA approvals because these products have been grandfathered into the provisions of the 1938 Federal FDC Act or the 1962 amendments to the Act. These products are non-application drugs that are manufactured and marketed without FDA-issued ANDAs or NDAs on the basis of their having been marketed by industry prior to the 1962 Amendments of the FDC Act. We marketed nine such products during 2014, generating net sales revenue of $43.4 million. Of the nine products during 2014, two were approved through either an ANDA or an NDA prior to the filing of this Form 10-K. Following enactment of the FDC Act in 1938, drugs on the market prior to that time were exempted or “grandfathered” and manufacturers were not required to file an NDA. Recently, FDA has increased its efforts to force companies to file and seek FDA approval for grandfathered products. Efforts have included issuing notices to companies currently manufacturing these products to cease its distribution of said products.
233. On October 2, 2012, we received a Warning Letter from the FDA citing that we were manufacturing Pilocarpine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution (“PHOS”), a grandfathered drug, without an approved NDA. We fully cooperated with the FDA and discontinued selling PHOS. No enforcement action was initiated and no fines were assessed by the FDA against us and the loss of revenue associated with the discontinuation of PHOS was immaterial. Further, in the second quarter of 2012, we filed an ANDA for PHOS, which is currently under review by the FDA.
234. If the FDA issues additional Warning Letters with respect one or more of our grandfathered products, we may be forced to discontinue marketing the affected products, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
235. The FDA may authorize sales of some prescription pharmaceuticals on anon-prescription basis, which would reduce the profitability of ourprescription products.
236. The FDA may authorize sales of some prescription pharmaceuticals on a
237. non-prescription basis, which would reduce the profitability of our
238. prescription products.
239. From time to time, the FDA elects to permit sales of some pharmaceuticals currently sold on a prescription basis without a prescription. FDA approval of the sale of our products without a prescription would reduce demand for our competing prescription products and, accordingly, reduce our profits.
240. We could experience business interruptions at our manufacturing facilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
241. We manufacture drug products at one international and three domestic manufacturing facilities. Any one or more of these facilities may be forced to shut down or may be unable to operate at full capacity as a result of hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, storms and other extreme weather events as well as strikes, war, violent upheavals, terrorist acts and otherforce majeureevents. For example, our manufacturing facility in Somerset, New Jersey was shut down for approximately two weeks in October and November 2012 as a result of power outages and related business disruptions caused by Superstorm Sandy. A significant disruption at any of these facilities, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship drug products to the market on a timely basis, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
242. force majeure
243. The testing required for the regulatory approval of our products is conducted by independent third parties. Any failure by any of these third parties to perform this testing properly and in a timely manner may have an adverse effect upon our ability to obtain regulatory approvals.
244. Our applications for the regulatory approval of our products incorporate the results of testing and other information that is conducted or gathered by independent third parties (including, for example, manufacturers of raw materials, testing laboratories, contract research organizations or independent research facilities). Our ability to obtain regulatory approval of the products being tested is dependent upon the quality of the work performed by these third parties, the quality of the third parties’ facilities, and the accuracy of the information provided by third parties. We have little or no control over any of these factors. If this testing is not performed properly, our ability to obtain regulatory approvals could be restricted or delayed.
245. We may be subject to disruptions or failures in our information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
246. We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business. We also hold data in various data center facilities upon which our business depends. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, system implementations or upgrades, computer viruses, third-party security breaches, employee error, theft or misuse, malfeasance, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security, loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information. Any of these events could result in the loss of key information, impair our production and supply chain processes, harm our competitive position, cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. While we have implemented a number of protective measures, such measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent or fully address the adverse effect of such events.
247. Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
248. Our U.S. operations are currently subject to the FCPA. We are required to comply with the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of “off books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. While we believe we have effective compliance programs in place to prevent violations of these laws, if our employees, third-party sales representatives or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other remedial measures, including further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, as well as potential personnel changes and disciplinary actions.
249. The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources anddistract management.
250. The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and
251. distract management.
252. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). These requirements are extensive. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight is required. This may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
253. We may issue preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock may reduce the market value of our common stock.
254. We are authorized to issue up to a total of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Subject to certain limitations, our board of directors may authorize issuance of shares of preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock without further action by holders of our common stock. If we issue shares of preferred stock, it could affect the rights or reduce the market value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. These terms may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions. We continue to seek capital for the growth of our business, and this additional capital may be raised through the issuance of preferred stock.
255. We experience significant quarterly fluctuation of our results of operations,which may increase the volatility of our stock price.
256. We experience significant quarterly fluctuation of our results of operations,
257. which may increase the volatility of our stock price.
258. Our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the timing of the development and marketing of new pharmaceutical products, the failure to develop such products, delays in obtaining government approvals, including FDA approval of NDAs or ANDAs for our products, expenditures to comply with governmental requirements for manufacturing facilities, expenditures incurred to acquire and promote pharmaceutical products, changes in our customer base, a customer’s termination of a substantial account, the availability and cost of raw materials, interruptions in supply by third-party manufacturers, seasonal or cyclical fluctuations in the sales of certain of our products, the introduction of new products or technological innovations by our competitors, loss of key personnel, changes in the mix of products sold by us, changes in sales and marketing expenditures, competitive pricing pressures, expenditures incurred to pursue or contest pending or threatened legal action and our ability to meet our financial covenants. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in avoiding losses in any future period. Such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of our common stock.
259. Charges to earnings resulting from acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.
260. Under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) business acquisition accounting standards, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in acquired companies generally at their acquisition date fair values and, in each case, separately from goodwill. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred, which is also generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and adversely affect our operating results and may adversely affect our cash flow:
261. costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment or relocation expenses;
262. impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, including acquired IPR&D;
263. amortization of intangible assets acquired;
264. a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired;
265. identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities, including, but not limited to, contingent purchase price consideration, income tax contingencies and other non-income tax contingencies, after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period (generally up to one year from the acquisition date), whichever comes first;
266. charges to our operating results to eliminate certain duplicative pre-acquisition activities, to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure;
267. charges to our operating results resulting from expenses incurred to effect the acquisition;
268. changes to contingent consideration liabilities, including accretion and fair value adjustments. A significant portion of these adjustments could be accounted for as expenses that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those costs are incurred. Such charges could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flow, and could cause the market value of the common stock to decline.
269. As of December 31, 2014, we had recorded $278.8 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet.

213. RISK FACTORS
214. Current Economic and Political Risks
215. Difficult conditions in the global capital markets and economy generally, as well as political conditions in the United States and elsewhere, may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
216. Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital.
217. We can be adversely affected by the impairment of other financial institutions.
218. Any reduction in the Companys and its subsidiaries credit ratings could increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
219. Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease revenue we receive from our international operations.
220. Legal and Regulatory Risks
221. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 will significantly impact our business practices and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
222. Proposed legislative and regulatory reforms could, if enacted or adopted, result in our business becoming subject to significant and extensive additional regulations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
223. Potential actions by the FDIC and the rating agencies could impact the Companys ABS program.
224. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by increases in FDIC deposit insurance assessments.
225. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by new regulation and supervision to which we are subject as a result of becoming a bank holding company.
226. We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our capital stock.
227. Banks, card issuers and card network operators generally are the subject of increasing global regulatory focus, which may impose costly new compliance burdens on our Company and lead to decreased transaction volumes and revenues through our network.
228. If we are not able to protect our intellectual property, and invest successfully in, and compete at the leading edge of, technological developments across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected.
229. Regulation in the areas of privacy and data security could increase our costs and decrease the number of charge and credit cards issued.
230. Our success is dependent, in part, upon our executive officers and other key personnel, and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business.
231. Litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties and/or requirements resulting in increased expenses.
232. Business Risks
233. Our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry.
234. We face increasingly intense competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants who accept our Cards for payment for goods and services.
235. We may not be successful in our efforts to promote Card usage through our marketing, promotion and rewards programs or to effectively control the costs of such programs, both of which may impact our profitability.
236. Our brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.
237. An increase in account data breaches and fraudulent activity using our Cards could lead to reputational damage to our brand and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit Cards.
238. We have agreements with business partners in a variety of industries, including the airline industry, that represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with these industries, including bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations and alliances of our partners, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.
239. Our reengineering and other cost control initiatives may not prove successful, and we may not realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we intended.
240. Our risk management policies and procedures may not be effective.
241. An inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.
242. If our global network systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions efficiently or at all, our revenue and profitability would be materially reduced.
243. We rely on third-party providers of various computer systems and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.

284. The interchange fee, which is the collectively set fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank in four party payment networks, like Visa and MasterCard, is generally the largest component of the merchant service charge payable by merchants for bankcard debit and credit card acceptance in these systems.By contrast, the American Express network does not have collectively set interchange fees. Although the regulators focus has primarily been on Visa and MasterCard as the dominant card networks and their operations on a multilateral basis, antitrust actions and government regulation of the bankcard associations pricing could ultimately affect all networks. Lower interchange and/or merchant discount revenue may lead card issuers to look for other sources of revenue from consumers such as higher annual card fees or interest charges, as well as to reduce costs by scaling back or eliminating rewards programs.

287. Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, our hedging strategies and other risk management techniques may not be fully effective. SeeFinancial ReviewRisk Management on pages47-49 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders for a discussion of the policies and procedures we use to identify, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses. Management of credit, market and operational risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective.

292. was a challenging year characterized by a weak economy, frozen credit markets in the first half of the year and high credit losses industrywide. In the first two quarters, the Companys spending and cardmember loan balances declined by double digits as compared to the corresponding periods in 2008 and credit metrics (e.g. past due and write-off rates) peaked at historically high levels. In the third quarter, the Companys credit actions began to positively impact past due and write-off rates and spending declines began to become less severe. The fourth quarter showed greater improvement.
293. In the fourth quarter of 2009 the year-over-year growth rate in cardmember spending volumes was positive for the first time since the third quarter of 2008, benefiting from both easier comparisons to year-ago billings as well as higher levels of spending. Improvements in billed business trends were experienced in all business lines in the fourth quarter. In addition, for the first time during the year, the growth rate in both the number of card transactions and average transaction size were positive in the fourth quarter as compared to the corresponding period in 2008. Despite these favorable trends, the Company expects the global economy to continue to recover gradually and the resulting environment to be characterized by billings growth that is more modest than it experienced before the recession, as consumers and businesses remain cautious about their spending.
294. For a complete discussion of our 2009 financial results, including financial information regarding each of our reportable operating segments, see pages 18-128 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated herein by reference. For a summary of the Company and our reportable operating segments, and a discussion of our principal sources of revenue, see pages 18-21 and pages 73-74, respectively, of the 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.
295. The Companys range of products and services include:
296. charge and credit card products
297. expense management products and services
298. consumer and business travel services
299. stored value products such as Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products
300. network services for the Companys network partners
301. merchant acquisition and processing, point-of-sale, servicing and settlement and marketing and information products and services for merchants
302. fee services, including market and trend analyses along with related consulting services and customer loyalty and rewards programs.
303. The Companys products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, middle-market companies, and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels including direct mail, on-line, targeted sales forces, and direct response advertising.
304. Our general-purpose card network, card-issuing and merchant-acquiring and processing businesses are global in scope. We are a world leader in providing charge and credit cards to consumers, small businesses and corporations. These cards include cards issued by American Express as well as cards issued by third-party banks
305. and other institutions that are accepted on the American Express network (collectively, Cards). Our Cards permit our cardmembers (Cardmembers) to charge purchases of goods and services in most countries around the world at the millions of merchants that accept Cards bearing our logo. We have total worldwide Cards-in-force of 87.9 million (including Cards issued by third parties). In 2009, our worldwide billed business (spending on American Express®Cards, including Cards issued by third parties) was $620 billion.
306. Our business as a whole has not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations, although travel sales generally tend to be highest in the second and fourth quarters. Travelers Cheque sales and Travelers Cheques outstanding tend to be greatest each year in the summer months, peaking in the third quarter. American Express®Gift Card sales are highest in the months of November and December; and Card billed business tends to be moderately higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters.
307. To put us in a better position to grow within our traditional businesses, new revenue categories and emerging payments, we implemented a number of organizational changes in October 2009. To realize the full potential of our traditional card and network businesses, we grouped our global consumer and small business card-issuing, merchant and network businesses under the senior leadership of our Vice Chairman. This move will enable us to sharpen our focus on our strongest growth opportunities, while maintaining the appropriate confidentiality protections. We are also creating an Enterprise Growth Group that will focus exclusively on generating new sources of fee revenue from our existing assets and advancing our efforts in emerging payments. This includes developing new opportunities for growth that transcend individual businesses and take advantage of technological trends. In addition, under the leadership of our Group President and Chief Information Officer, we created a new Global Services Group that unites our U.S. and international cardmember servicing organizations, as well as most processing and support functions across the Company, including among others, technology support and certain key processing functions in areas such as finance and human resources. With this change to Global Services, the Company is organizing support functions by process rather than business unit, which the Company expects will streamline costs, reduce duplication of work, better integrate skills and expertise, and improve customer service. This organization has been tasked with generating an annualized level of gross expense savings of approximately $500 million by 2012. It is expected that a portion of any such savings would be reinvested in growth initiatives. Also, as part of the organizational changes, our Chief Executive Officer is now working directly with the leaders of our Global Commercial Card and Global Travel Services groups on overall strategies to capitalize on Business-to-Business growth opportunities.
308. Despite the challenges of the current economic environment, we believe our spend-centric business model (which focuses on generating revenues primarily by driving spending on our Cards and secondarily by finance charges and fees) continues to give us significant competitive advantages, even when the overall spending level is down. Average spending on our Cards, which is substantially higher on a per-card basis for us versus our competitors, represents greater value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and higher sales. This enables us to earn a premium discount rate and thereby invest in greater value-added services for merchants and Cardmembers. As a result of the higher revenues generated from higher spending, we have the flexibility to offer more attractive rewards, other incentives to Cardmembers and targeted marketing programs for merchants, which in turn creates an incentive for Cardmembers to spend more on their Cards. The significant investments we make in rewards and other compelling value propositions for Cardmembers drives Card usage at merchants. This business model, along with our closed-loop network, in which we are both the Card issuer and, in most instances, the merchant acquirer, gives us a competitive advantage that we seek to leverage to provide more value to Cardmembers, merchants and our Card-issuing partners.
309. Our brand and its attributestrust, security, integrity, quality and customer serviceare key assets of the Company. We continue to focus on our brand by educating employees about these attributes and by incorporating them into our programs, products and services. Our brand has consistently been rated one of the most valuable brands in the world in published studies, and we believe it provides us with a significant competitive advantage.
310. We believe our brand and its attributes are critical to our success, and we invest heavily in managing, marketing and promoting it. In addition, we place significant importance on trademarks, service marks and patents, and diligently protect our intellectual property rights around the world.
311. The Global Network & Merchant Services (GNMS) segment operates a global general-purpose charge and credit card network for both proprietary Cards and Cards issued under the global network services business. It also manages merchant services globally, which includes signing merchants to accept Cards as well as processing and settling Card transactions for those merchants. This segment also offers merchants point-of-sale, servicing and settlement and marketing and information products and services.
312. Cards bearing our logo are issued by our principal operating subsidiary, TRS, the Companys U.S. bank subsidiaries, American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank) and American Express Bank, FSB (AEBFSB), and by other operating and bank subsidiaries outside the United States. They are accepted at all merchant locations worldwide that accept American Express-branded Cards. In addition, depending on the product, Cards bearing our logo are generally accepted at ATM locations worldwide that accept Cards. TRS and its subsidiaries, including Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, issue the majority of Cards on our network.
313. Our Global Network Services (GNS) business establishes and maintains relationships with banks and other institutions around the world that issue Cards and, in certain countries, acquire local merchants on the American Express network. GNS is key to our strategy of broadening the Cardmember and merchant base for our network worldwide.
314. Our Global Merchant Services (GMS) business provides us with access to rich transaction data through our closed-loop network, which encompasses relationships with both the Cardmember and the merchant. This capability helps us acquire new merchants, deepen relationships with existing merchants, process transactions, and provide targeted marketing, analytical and other value-added services to merchants in our network. In addition, it allows us to analyze trends and spending patterns among various segments of our customer base.
315. A key asset of our network is the American Express brand, which is one of the worlds most highly recognized and respected brands.
316. We continue to pursue a strategy, through our GNS business, of inviting U.S. and foreign banks and other institutions to issue Cards and acquire merchants on the American Express network. By leveraging our global infrastructure and the appeal of the American Express brand, we broaden our Cardmember and merchant base for our network worldwide. The GNS business has established more than 130 card-issuing and/or merchant-acquiring arrangements with banks and other institutions in 129 countries.
317. Historically, we had successfully implemented our GNS business strategy in a number of countries outside the United States. In contrast to the situation outside the United States, until 2004, no major U.S. banks had issued Cards in the United States on the American Express global network. This situation was the result of rules and policies of Visa Inc., Visa USA, and Visa International (collectively Visa) and MasterCard International, Inc. (MasterCard) in the United States at the time, which mandated expulsion of members that issued American Express-branded Cards. These rules were struck down in 2004 in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. As a result of this decision, beginning in 2004, we have been able to extend our network to other card issuers in the United States, just as we have done internationally.
318. In 2009, GNS signed 7 new partners to issue Cards and/or acquire merchants on the American Express network. Additionally, GNS partners launched approximately 100 new products during 2009, bringing the total number of American Express-branded GNS partner products launched to date to approximately 1,030.
319. GNS focuses on partnering with qualified third-party banks and other financial institutions that choose to issue Cards accepted on our global network and/or acquire merchants on our network. Although we customize our network arrangements to the particular country and each partners requirements, as well as to our strategic plans in that marketplace, all GNS arrangements are designed to help issuers develop products for their highest-spending and most affluent customers and to support the value of American Express Card acceptance to merchants. We choose to partner with institutions that share a core set of attributes compatible with the American Express brand, such as commitment to high quality standards and strong marketing expertise, and we require adherence to our product, brand and service standards.**
320. With approximately 1,030 different Card products launched on our network so far by our partners, GNS is an increasingly important business that is strengthening our brand visibility around the world, driving more transaction volume onto our merchant network and increasing the number of merchants accepting the American Express Card. GNS enables us to expand our networks global presence generally without assuming additional Cardmember credit risk or having to invest a large amount of resources, as our GNS partners already have established attractive customer bases they can target with American Express-branded products, and are responsible for managing the credit risk associated with the Cards they issue. Since 1999, Cards-in-force issued by GNS partners have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 25%, and totaled over 26 million Cards at the end of 2009. Outside the United States, 74% of new Cards issued in 2009 were Cards issued by GNS partners. Spending on GNS Cards has grown at a compound annual rate of 25% since 1999. Year over year spending growth on these Cards in 2009 was 7%, with total spending equal to $72 billion.
321. Although the structures and details of each of the GNS arrangements vary, all of them generate revenues for us from the Card transaction volumes they drive on the American Express network. Gross revenues we receive per dollar spent on a Card issued by a GNS partner are lower than those from our proprietary Card-issuing business. However, because the GNS partner is responsible for most of the operating costs and risk of its Card-issuing business, our operating expenses and credit losses are lower than those in our proprietary Card-issuing business. The GNS business model generates an attractive earnings stream and risk profile that requires a lower level of capital support. The return on equity in our GNS business can thus be significantly higher than that of our proprietary Card-issuing business. In addition, since the majority of GNS costs are fixed, the GNS business is highly scalable. GNS partners benefit from their association with the American Express brand and their ability to gain attractive revenue streams and expand and differentiate their product offerings with innovative marketing programs.
322. Our GNS arrangements fall into the following three main categories: Independent Operator Arrangements, Network Card License Arrangements and Joint Venture Arrangements.
323. The first type of GNS arrangement is known as an independent operator (IO) arrangement. As of the end of 2009, we had 65 of these arrangements around the world. We pursue these arrangements to expand the presence of the American Express network in markets in which we do not offer a proprietary local currency Card. The partners local presence and relationships help us enhance the impact of our brand in the market, reach
324. The use of the term partner or partnering does not mean or imply a formal legal partnership, and is not meant in any way to alter the terms of American Expresss relationship with third-party issuers and merchant acquirers.
325. merchant coverage goals more quickly, and operate at economic scale and cost levels that would be difficult for us to achieve on our own. Subject to meeting our standards, IO bank partners are licensed to issue local currency Cards in their markets, including the classic Green, Gold and Platinum American Express Cards. In addition, the majority of these partners serve as the merchant acquirer and processor for local merchants. American Express retains the relationship with multinational merchants. Our IO partners own the customer relationships and credit risk for the Cards they issue, and make the decisions about which customers will be issued Cards. GNS generates revenues in IO arrangements from Card licensing fees, royalties on Cardmember billings, foreign exchange conversion revenue, royalties on charge volume at merchants, share of discount revenue and, in some partnerships, royalties on net spread revenue or royalties on cards-in-force. Our IO partners are responsible for transaction authorization, billing and pricing, Cardmember and merchant servicing, and funding Card receivables for their Cards and payables for their merchants.
326. We bear the credit risk arising from the IO partners potential failure to meet its settlement obligations to us. We mitigate this risk by partnering with institutions that we believe are financially sound and will meet their obligations, and by monitoring their financial health, their compliance with the terms of their relationship with us and the political, economic and regulatory environment in which they operate. In addition, depending on an IO partners credit rating and other indicators of financial health, we may require an IO partner to post a letter of credit, bank guarantee or other collateral to reduce this risk.
327. Examples of countries where we have entered into IO arrangements include Brazil, Russia, China, Ecuador, Greece, South Korea, Pakistan, Croatia, Peru, Portugal, Vietnam, Georgia and Bangladesh. Through our IO partnerships, we believe we can accelerate growth in Cardmember spending, Cards-in-force and merchant acceptance in these countries.
328. The second type of GNS arrangement is known as a network card license (NCL). At the end of 2009, we had 61 of these arrangements in place worldwide. We pursue these arrangements to increase our brand presence and gain market share in markets in which we have a proprietary Card-issuing and/or merchant acquiring business and, in a few cases, those in which we have IO partners. In an NCL arrangement, we grant the third-party financial institution a license to issue American Express-branded Cards. The NCL issuer owns the customer relationships for all Cards it issues, provides customer service to its Cardmembers, authorizes transactions, manages billing and credit, is responsible for marketing the Cards, and designs Card product features (including rewards and other incentives for Cardmembers), subject to meeting certain standards. We operate the merchant network, route and process Card transactions from the merchants point-of-sale through submission to the issuer, and settle with issuers. The NCL is the type of arrangement we have implemented with banks in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Japan.
329. GNS revenues in NCL arrangements are driven by a variety of factors, including the level of Cardmember spending, royalties, currency conversions and licensing fees paid by the partner and fees charged to the Card issuer based on charge volume, and our provision of value-added services such as Cardmember insurance products and other Card features and benefits for the issuers Cards. As indicated above, the NCL issuer bears the credit risk for the issued Cards, as well as the Card marketing and acquisition costs, Cardmember fraud risks and costs of rewards and other loyalty initiatives. We bear the risk arising from the NCL partners potential failure to meet its settlement obligations to us. We mitigate this risk by partnering with institutions that we believe are financially sound and will meet their obligations, and by monitoring their financial health, their compliance with the terms of their relationship with us and the political, economic and regulatory environment in which they operate. In addition, depending on an NCL issuers credit rating and other indicators of financial health, we may require an NCL issuer to post a letter of credit, bank guarantee or other collateral to reduce this risk.
330. Examples of NCL arrangements include our relationships with Bank of America in the United States, Lloyds TSB Bank in the United Kingdom and Westpac Banking Corporation in Australia.
331. The third type of GNS arrangement is a joint venture (JV) arrangement. We have utilized this type of arrangement in Switzerland and Belgium, as well as in other countries. In these markets, we join with a third-party to establish a separate business in which we have a significant ownership stake. The JV typically signs new merchants to the American Express network and issues local currency Cards that carry our logo. In a JV arrangement, the JV is responsible for the Cardmember credit risk and bears the operating and marketing costs. Unlike the other two types of GNS arrangements, we share management, risk, and profit and loss responsibility with our JV partners. Income is generated by discount revenues, card fees and net spread revenues. The economics of the JV are similar to those of our proprietary Card-issuing business, which we discuss under U.S. Card Services, and we receive a portion of the JVs income depending on, among other things, the level of our ownership interest. Our subsidiary, AEOCC Ltd., purchases card receivables from certain of the GNS JVs from time to time.
332. Outside the United States we signed a number of agreements in 2009 to enhance our presence in existing markets and further expanded our global presence into new markets.
333. Some of the highlights of our GNS business outside the United States in 2009 include:
334. Announcement of new card partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region with ANZ, one of the largest banks in Australia and a leading bank in New Zealand and the South Pacific, Commonwealth Bank, which operates the largest financial services distribution network in Australia, and United Overseas Bank Limited (UOB), one of the leading credit card issuers in Singapore
335. Announcement of our new partnership in Brazil with Banco do Brasil and the issuance of the Ourocard Estilo Platinum American Express and Ourocard Platinum American Express®products
336. Issuance of the City Bank American Express®Gold Credit Card and the City Bank American Express®Credit Card in Bangladesh, with our new partner, City Bank
337. Launch of the American Express®Card and the American Express®Gold Card in Georgia, with our new partner, Bank of Georgia.
338. GNS continues to expand its airline co-brand portfolio, launching 12 new airline co-brands in 2009 bringing the total to 49 airline co-brand products. Some of the key airline co-brand launches outside the United States in 2009 include:
339. Launch of Quantas Airlines co-brand cards with National Australia Bank and ANZ in Australia
340. Launch of the Turkish Airlines co-brand card with Garanti Bank.
341. Some of the highlights of our GNS business in the United States in 2009 include:
342. Launch of The PenFed Premium Travel Rewards American Express®Card with our new partner Pentagon Federal Credit Union (PenFed)
343. Expansion of our wealth management portfolio in the United States with Bank of Americas launch of the Merrill Accolades American Express®Card, developed for Bank of America Merrill Lynchs wealth management clients
344. Launch of The Fidelity®Private Client American Express®Card, the fourth Card in Fidelitys American Express portfolio.
345. We operate a GMS business, which includes signing merchants to accept Cards, accepting and processing Card transactions, and settling with merchants that accept Cards for purchases made by Cardmembers with Cards (Charges). We also provide marketing, information and programs to merchants, leveraging the capabilities provided by our closed-loop structure, as well as point-of-sale products and servicing.
346. Our objective is for Cardmembers to be able to use the Card wherever and however they desire, and to increase merchant coverage in key geographic areas and in selected new industries that have not traditionally accepted general-purpose credit and charge cards as a means of payment. We add new merchants to our network through a number of sales channels: a proprietary sales force, third-party sales and service agents, strategic alliances with banks and processors, the Internet, telemarketing and inbound Want to Honor calls (i.e., where merchants desiring to accept the Card contact us directly). As discussed in the Global Network Services section, our IO partners and JVs also add new local merchants to the American Express network.
347. During 2009, we continued expanding our integrated American Express OnePoint®solution for small- and medium-sized merchants. Under this program, third-party service agents provide payment processing services to merchants on our behalf for Card transactions, while we retain the acceptance contract with participating merchants, establish merchant pricing and receive the same transactional information we always have received through our closed-loop network. This program simplifies card processing for small- and medium-sized merchants by providing them with a single source for statements, settlement and customer service.
348. GMS continues to significantly expand the number of merchants that accept our Card products as well as the kinds of businesses that accept the Card. Over the last several years, we have focused our efforts on increasing the use of our Cards for everyday spending. In 1990, 64% of our U.S. billings came from the travel and entertainment sectors and 36% came from retail and other sectors. That proportion has now been more than reversed. In 2009, U.S. non-travel and entertainment billings represented approximately 71% of the U.S. billed business on American Express Cards. This shift resulted from the growth, over time, in the types of merchants that began to accept charge and credit cards in response to consumers increased desire to use these cards for more of their purchases, and our focus on expanding Card acceptance to meet Cardmembers needs.
349. During 2009, we continued our efforts to encourage consumers to use the Card for everyday spending and to increase the number and types of merchants in retail and everyday spending categories that accept the Card, such as quick-serve restaurants, mass transit and recurring billing merchants. For example, during 2009, we announced Card acceptance agreements in the United States with:
350. Hennes & Mauritz (H&M)
351. Weis Markets Inc.
352. Outside the United States, we signed card acceptance agreements with:
353. McDonalds Restaurants of Canada Limited, now accepting the Card at 1,200 locations across Canada
354. Air Asia, Asias leading lowfare carrier
355. Yahoo! Auction, now accepting the Card in Japan
356. PTT Public Company Limited, the largest petrol retail distributor in Thailand, now accepting the Card at its more than 900 petroleum service stations.
357. In addition, we continued our drive to bring Card acceptance to industries where cash or checks are the predominant form of payment. For example, we have made headway in promoting Card acceptance payments in
358. industries such as pharmaceuticals, construction, industrial supply and advertising. Acceptance agreements signed in 2009 in the United States include:
359. Lehigh Hanson, one of North Americas largest suppliers of heavy building materials to the construction industry
360. Professional Veterinary Products, one of the nations largest animal health products distributors.
361. Internationally, among others, a Card acceptance agreement was reached with Travis Perkins, a leading builders merchant and home improvement retailer headquartered in the United Kingdom, with more than 1,000 locations.
362. Globally, acceptance of general-purpose charge and credit cards continues to increase. As in prior years, during 2009, we continued to grow merchant acceptance of Cards around the world and to refine our approach to calculating merchant coverage in accordance with changes in the marketplace. Management estimates that, as of the end of 2009, our merchant network in the United States accommodated more than 90% of our Cardmembers general-purpose charge and credit card spending, and our international merchant network as a whole accommodated approximately 80% of our Cardmembers general-purpose charge and credit card spending. These percentages are based on comparing our Cardmembers spending on our network currently with our estimate of what our Cardmembers would spend on our network if all merchants that accept general-purpose credit and charge cards accepted American Express Cards.
363. We earn discount revenue from fees charged to merchants for accepting Cards as payment for goods or services sold. The merchant discount is the fee charged to the merchant for accepting Cards and is generally expressed as a percentage of the amount charged on a Card. In some instances, an additional flat transaction fee is assessed. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the amount of the payment that the merchant acquirer (in most cases, TRS or one of its subsidiaries) pays to a merchant for Charges submitted. A merchant acquirer is the entity that contracts for Card acceptance with the merchant, accepts transactions from the merchant, pays the merchant for these transactions and submits the transactions to the American Express network, which submits the transactions to the appropriate Card issuer. When a Cardmember presents the Card for payment, the merchant creates a record of charge for the transaction and submits it to the merchant acquirer for payment. To the extent that TRS or one of its subsidiaries is the merchant acquirer, the merchant discount is recorded by us as discount revenue at the time the transaction is received by us from the merchant.
364. Where we act as the merchant acquirer and the Card presented at a merchant is issued by a third-party bank or financial institution, such as in the case of our GNS partners, we will make financial settlement to the merchant and receive the discount revenue. In our role as the operator of the Card network, we will also receive financial settlement from the Card issuer, who receives an issuer rate (i.e., the individually negotiated amount that Card issuers receive for transactions charged on our network with Cards they issue, which is usually expressed as a percentage of the charged amount). The difference between the discount revenue (received by us in the form of the merchant discount) and the issuer rate received by the Card issuer generates a return to us. In cases where American Express is the Card issuer and the merchant acquirer is a third-party bank or financial institution (which can be the case in a country in which the IO is the local merchant acquirer), we receive an individually negotiated issuer rate in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is recorded by us as discount revenue. By contrast with networks such as Visa and MasterCard, there is no collectively set interchange rate on the American Express network.
365. The following diagrams depict the relationships among the parties in a point-of-sale transaction effected on the American Express network where we act as both the Card issuer and merchant acquirer (the 3-Party Model) and under an NCL arrangement where third-party financial institutions act as Card issuers (the NCL Model):
366. The merchant discount we charge is principally determined by the value we deliver to the merchant and generally represents a premium over other networks. We deliver greater value to merchants through higher spending Cardmembers relative to users of cards issued on competing card networks, our marketing expertise, information and fraud services, and Cardmembers insistence on using their Cards when enrolled in rewards or other Card loyalty programs, including Cardmembers who are part of our Corporate Card program.
367. The merchant discount varies, among other factors, with the industry in which the merchant does business, the merchants Charge volume, the timing and method of payment to the merchant, the method of submission of Charges and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the Card acceptance agreement signed with us (local or global) and the Charge amount.
368. In 2009, as in prior years, we experienced some reduction in our global weighted average merchant discount rate. Over time, selective re-pricing initiatives, changes in the mix of business and volume-related pricing discounts likely will continue to result in some erosion in the average discount rate.
369. While most merchants that accept our Cards understand our merchant discount pricing in relation to the value provided, we do encounter a relatively small number of merchants that accept our Cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment and, consequently, suppress use of the Card. Subject to local legal requirements, we respond to this issue vigorously to ensure that our Cardmembers are able to use their Card where and when they want to and to protect the American Express brand. We have made progress limiting Card suppression by concentrating on acquiring merchants where Cardmembers want to use the Card; continuing to enhance the value we provide to merchants through programs such as DailyWish and American
370. Express Selects®, which enable merchants of any size to gain valuable exposure and additional sales by providing exclusive offers and experiences to American Express Cardmembers; developing and providing new and innovative business insights and fraud tools using information available through our closed-loop network; providing better and earlier communication of our value proposition; and, when appropriate, cancelling merchants who suppress the use of our Card products. We recognize that it is the merchants choice whether or not to accept American Express cards, and therefore we dedicate substantial resources to delivering value to attract and retain our merchant customers.
371. The laws of certain countries and most states in the United States do not prohibit merchants from surcharging credit card purchases. American Express policy generally does not prohibit surcharging so long as it is permitted by law and a merchant does not discriminate against the Card by surcharging higher amounts on purchases with the Card than is imposed for purchases with other cards, or by imposing a surcharge only on Card purchases, but not on purchases made with other cards. American Express also does not prohibit merchants from offering discounts to customers who pay with cash or check. For information concerning the Department of Justices information and document request regarding our policies relating to merchant surcharging and anti-steering, please see Other Matters within Legal Proceedings below beginning on page 87.
372. Merchant satisfaction is a key goal of our GMS business. We focus on understanding and addressing factors that influence merchant satisfaction, including developing and executing innovative programs that increase Card usage at merchants, using technology resources, enhancing operational efficiencies and merchants ease of doing business with us, making our United States operating procedures easily available to merchants on our Web site, applying our closed-loop capabilities and deep marketing expertise, and strengthening our relationships with merchants through an expanding roster of services that helps them meet their business goals.
373. We also offer our merchant customers a full range of point-of-sale solutions, including integrated point-of-sale terminals, software, online solutions, and direct links that allow merchants to accept American Express Cards (as well as credit and debit cards issued on other networks and checks). Virtually all proprietary point-of-sale solutions support direct processing (i.e., direct connectivity) to American Express, which can lower a merchants cost of Card acceptance and enhance payment efficiency.
374. We continue to focus our commitment to driving global interoperability in payment card specifications, making it easier for merchants to accept our Cards, for Cardmembers to have a more seamless experience at the point of sale, and for issuers who have more than one network relationship to have a standard across their card products. In January 2009, we became the fourth owner-member of EMVCo, the standards body that manages, maintains, and enhances specifications for chip-based payment cards and acceptance devices, including point-of-sale terminals. Our participation in this company will help drive secure and interoperable payments globally for transactions made with chip cards by aligning and progressing the EMV specifications. Further, as EMVCos scope expands to include emerging payment technologies such as contactless cards and mobile phones, our participation will allow for our products and specifications to be universally compatible and ready for merchant acceptance.
375. We continue to focus our efforts in areas that make use and acceptance of the Card more convenient for merchants and Cardmembers. For instance, ExpressPay from American Express®, a contactless payment feature embedded in certain cards, continues to provide a fast, easy-to-use alternative for making everyday purchases at merchants where speed and convenience is important. In the U.S., top quick-service restaurants, movie theaters, drug and convenience stores and major retail chains readily accept payments through ExpressPay, which is powered by radio-frequency technology that is currently embedded within several Card products. Similarly, Automatic Bill Payment focuses on providing convenience by allowing merchants to bill Cardmembers on a regular basis for recurring charges approved by the Cardmember such as insurance premiums, newspaper subscriptions, health club memberships, commutation costs and telecommunication services. We have also made modifications to our host authorization system to approve more transactions and reduce Cardmember inconvenience at the point-of-sale including eliminating the signature requirement for transactions of $25 or less.
376. Wherever we manage both the acquiring relationship with merchants and the Card-issuing side of the business, there is a closed-loop, which distinguishes our network from the bankcard networks, in that we have access to information at both ends of the Card transaction. We maintain direct relationships with both our Cardmembers and our merchants, and we handle all key aspects of those relationships. Our relationships allow us to analyze information on Cardmember spend. This enables us to provide targeted marketing for merchants and special offers to Cardmembers through a variety of channels. At the same time, we protect the confidentiality of this data, and comply with our privacy and firewall policies and applicable legal requirements.
377. We work closely with our Card-issuing and merchant-acquiring bank partners to maintain key elements of this closed-loop, which permits them to customize marketing efforts, deliver greater value to their Cardmembers and help us to direct increased business to merchants who accept the Card.
378. As the merchant acquirer, we have certain exposures that arise if a billing dispute between a Cardmember and a merchant is settled in favor of the Cardmember. Drivers of this liability are returns in the normal course of business, disputes over fraudulent charges, the quality or non-delivery of goods and services and billing errors. Typically, we offset the amount due to the Cardmember against payments for the merchants current or future Charge submissions. We can realize losses when a merchants offsetting Charge submissions cease, such as when the merchant decides to no longer accept the Card, commences a bankruptcy proceeding or goes out of business. We actively monitor our merchant base to assess the risk of this exposure. When appropriate, we will take action to reduce the net exposure to a given merchant by holding cash reserves funded through Charge payable holdbacks from a merchant, lengthening the time between when the merchant submits a Charge for payment and when we pay the merchant by requiring the merchant to secure a letter of credit or a parent company guarantee, or implementing other appropriate risk management tools. We also establish reserves on our balance sheet for these contingencies in accordance with relevant accounting rules.
379. With the increase in electronic transmission of payment card transaction data over merchants point-of-sale systems, American Express and the other major card networks recognized the necessity for merchants and merchant processors to secure this data against accidental or intentional compromise using a standard protocol that applies to all card types. In 2006, in order to strengthen the security practices of merchants and payment processing firms and to secure payment account data in a globally consistent manner, we and Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard Worldwide and Visa formed PCI Security Standards Council, LLC (PCI SSC), an independent standards-setting organization. PCI SSCs role is to manage the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard, and more recently the PCI PIN Entry Device (PED) Security Requirements and the Payment Application Data Security Standard, which focus on improving payment card account security throughout the transaction process. By establishing PCI SSC, we and the other founders have developed common standards that are more accessible and efficient for participants in the payment card industry. All our merchants and service providers that store, process and transmit payment card data are required to comply with the PCI Data Security Standard. PCI SSC is dedicated to driving greater education, awareness and adoption of these security standards to ensure that all stakeholders involved in the payment process conduct their business responsibly.
380. In some markets outside the United States, particularly in Asia, third-party processors and some bankcard acquirers have begun to offer merchants the capability of converting credit card transactions from the local currency to the currency of the cardholders residence (i.e., the cardholders billing currency) at the point-of-sale, and submitting the transaction in the cardholders billing currency, thus bypassing the traditional foreign currency conversion process of the card network. This practice is known as dynamic currency conversion. If a merchant utilizes a dynamic currency conversion process, the merchant and processor share any fee assessed or spread earned for converting the transaction at the point-of-sale, thus reducing or eliminating revenue for card issuers and card networks relating to the conversion of foreign charges to the cardholders billing currency. This practice is not widespread, and it is uncertain to what extent consumers will prefer to have foreign currency transactions converted by merchants in this way. Our policy generally requires merchants to submit Charges and be paid in the currency of the country in which the transaction occurs, and we convert the transaction to the Cardmembers billing currency.
381. Our global card network, including our Global Merchant Services and Global Network Services businesses, competes with other charge and credit card networks, including, among others, Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club International (which was acquired by Discover Financial Services), Discover (primarily in the United States), and JCB Co., Ltd. (primarily in Asia). We are the third largest general-purpose charge and credit card network based on charge volume, behind Visa and MasterCard, which are larger than we are in most markets. In addition, apart from such network services, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers and processors, carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMS and GNS businesses. No single entity participates on a global basis in the full range of activities that are encompassed by our closed-loop business model.
382. The principal competitive factors that affect the network and merchant service businesses include:
383. the number of Cards-in-force and amount of spending on these Cards
384. the quantity and quality of the establishments where the Cards can be used
385. the economic attractiveness to card issuers and merchant acquirers of participating in the network
386. the success of marketing and promotional campaigns
387. reputation and brand recognition
388. innovation in systems, technology and product offerings, particularly in on-line commerce
389. the quality of customer service
390. the security of Cardmember and merchant information
391. the impact of existing litigation, legislation and government regulation
392. the cost of Card acceptance relative to the value provided.
393. Another aspect of network competition is the recent emergence and rapid growth of alternative payment mechanisms and systems, which include aggregators (such as PayPal), wireless payment technologies (including using mobile telephone networks to carry out transactions), prepaid systems and systems linked to credit cards, and bank transfer models. To the extent alternative payment mechanisms and systems, such as aggregators, continue to successfully expand in the online payments space, our merchant revenues and our ability to access transaction data through our closed-loop network could be negatively impacted. In the United States, alternative payment vehicles continue to emerge that seek to redirect online customers to payment systems based on ACH (automated clearing house, i.e., inter-bank transfer), and existing debit networks are making efforts to develop online PIN functionality, which could potentially reduce the relative use of charge and credit cards online. For a discussion concerning our recent acquisition of Revolution Money Inc. in the emerging payments area, please see Enterprise Growth beginning on page 34 below.
394. Some of our competitors have attempted to replicate our closed-loop structure, such as Visa, with its Visa Incentive Network. Although it remains to be seen how effective Visa will be, efforts by Visa and other card networks and payment providers to replicate the closed-loop speak to its continued value and to the intense competitive environment in which we operate.
395. Local regulations governing the issuance of charge and credit cards have not been a significant factor impacting GNS arrangements with banks and qualifying financial institutions, because such banks and institutions generally are already authorized to issue general-purpose cards and, in the case of our IO arrangements, to operate merchant-acquiring businesses. Accordingly, our GNS partners have generally not had difficulty obtaining appropriate government authorization in the markets in which we have chosen to enter into GNS arrangements. As a network service provider to regulated U.S. banks, our GNS business is subject to review
396. by certain federal bank regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision. As the operator of a general-purpose card network, we are also subject to certain provisions of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the accompanying regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (collectively referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act). We conduct due diligence on our GNS partners to ensure that they have implemented and maintain sufficient anti-money laundering (AML) controls to prevent our network from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes. As a result of American Express Company and TRS each becoming bank holding companies, our business is also subject to further regulation and regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve. For additional information about this change in regulatory status, please see Supervision and RegulationGeneral beginning on page 35 below.
397. In recent years, regulators in several countries outside the United States have focused on the fees involved in the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. Regulators in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Poland, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, the European Union (EU), Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, among others, have conducted investigations that are either ongoing or on appeal.
398. In certain countries where antitrust actions or regulations have led our competitors to lower their fees, we have made adjustments to our pricing to merchants to reflect local competitive trends. For example, reductions in bankcard interchange mandated by the Reserve Bank of Australia reforms in 2003 have resulted in lower merchant discount rates for Visa and MasterCard acceptance. As a result of changes in the marketplace, we have reduced our own merchant discount rates in Australia, although we have been able to increase billed business and the number of merchants accepting our Cards. In addition, under legislation enacted in Argentina, a merchant acquirer is required to charge the same merchant discount rate to all merchants in the same industry category, and merchant discount rates for credit cards cannot exceed 3%. The Central Bank of Venezuela has issued regulations regarding the maximum level of merchant discount rates by industry category. In Hungary, recently enacted legislation will require point-of-sale service charges not to exceed 2%.
399. In Europe, investigations of interchange are usually handled by the domestic competition law authorities, as well as the European Commission. In its Final Report on the retail banking sector issued in January 2007, which included a review of the payment cards industry, including interchange fees, the European Commission appeared to favor competition law enforcement tools, rather than regulation of price levels, to address perceived competition issues. The conclusions of the European Commission in its Final Report do not have the force of law, but may be used as the basis for future regulation or antitrust enforcement action in the EU Member States.
400. In December 2007, the European Commission ruled that MasterCards multilateral interchange fees (MIF) for cross-border payment card transactions violate EC Treaty rules on restrictive business practices. The Commissions decision applies to cross-border consumer credit, charge and debit card transactions within the EU and to domestic transactions to which MasterCard has chosen to apply the cross-border MIF. The ruling does not prevent MasterCard and its member banks from adopting an alternative MIF arrangement that can be proven to comply with EU Competition rules. Although the Commissions investigation included commercial cards, it has
401. reserved judgment for the time being on the legality of MasterCards cross-border MIF for commercial card transactions. MasterCard lodged an appeal against the Commissions findings, which is pending. An interim settlement has been agreed to between the Commission and MasterCard, capping MIF at 30 basis points for consumer card transactions and 20 basis points for debit card transactions.
402. In 2002, the Commission granted an exemption to Visa regarding its MIFs. This exemption expired on December 31, 2007 and in March 2008 the Commission opened formal antitrust proceedings against Visa Europe Limited in relation to Visas MIFs for cross-border consumer card transactions. The Commission has indicated that the MasterCard decision should provide Visa with guidance for the way ahead, although it stated that every MIF must be examined on its own merits.
403. These developments may affect how the competition authorities in the Member States of the EU view domestic interchange. In 2007, for example, the competition regulator in Poland found insufficient basis for Visa and MasterCard interchange fees and ordered the associations and their members to stop their current interchange setting practices immediately. The banks appealed that decision, and in November 2008 the decision was overturned. The Polish Competition Authority has appealed that ruling.
404. In August 2009, Visa and MasterCard settled an anti-trust case with the New Zealand regulatory authorities regarding whether the setting of interchange rates constituted price fixing and whether other scheme rules lessened competition. The settlement results in changes to the Visa and MasterCard scheme rules, which will set maximum interchange rates and also allow bilateral setting of lower interchange rates between issuers and acquirers, as well as remove the schemes no surcharging rules. The full extent of the impact of the changes to interchange on our discount rate in New Zealand is not likely to be known until the schemes publish their maximum interchange rates on April 17, 2010.
405. Regulators have also considered the industry practice of prohibiting merchants from passing the cost of merchant discount fees along to consumers through surcharges on card purchases. In Australia, we have seen selective, but increasing, merchant surcharging on our Cards in certain industries and, in some cases, on a basis that is greater than that applied to cards issued on the bankcard networks. The European Union has adopted a new legislative framework for electronic payment services, including cards, referred to as the Payment Services Directive. The Payment Services Directive prescribes common rules for licensing and supervision of payment services providers, including card issuers and merchant acquirers, and for their conduct of business. The objective of the Payment Services Directive is to facilitate the creation of a single, internal payments market in the EU through harmonization of EU Member State laws governing payment services. One provision of the Payment Services Directive permits merchants to surcharge, subject to disclosure requirements, but also allows individual Member States to override this rule by prohibiting or limiting surcharging. To date, the United Kingdom has decided to permit surcharging (and the United Kingdom has for a number of years permitted merchants to levy a surcharge on credit card purchases). There are varied approaches in most of the other countries where some prohibit surcharging, others allow surcharging, and still others allow surcharging but limit it in some way, such as by capping the surcharge allowed or limiting the types of transactions where surcharging is permitted. All member states permit or propose to permit discounts. The Payment Services Directive complements another European initiative, the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), which is an industry-led initiative with support from EU institutions. Among other changes, SEPA will involve the adoption of new, pan-European technical standards for cards and card transactions. All of the foregoing requires significant costs to implement and maintain.
406. In the United States, Congress continues to debate the interchange issue. There have been several hearings on Visa/MasterCard interchange over the last several years, and in 2009 at the request of Congress, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) completed a study on the structure of interchange fees and their impact on consumers and merchants. The report provides a balanced view of the interchange issue and explains how large merchants would benefit and how consumers could be harmed by the pending legislative proposals. In 2009, legislation was reintroduced in Congress that would give all U.S. merchants antitrust immunity to negotiate
407. collectively the price and terms of card acceptance on networks. The House Judiciary Committee bill covers networks with at least a 20% share of U.S. credit and debit card payments combined, which would not apply to the American Express network but, if enacted, would have an effect on American Express in the marketplace. The Senate version of the bill covers networks with at least 10% of U.S. credit or debit payments, which would apply to American Express. Both bills have a default process for having prices and terms set through government action rather than competitive forces. A similar version of the House bill (the Credit Card Fair Fee Act) was passed in the House Judiciary Committee in 2008. No action was taken on either of these bills in 2009. The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on a third piece of interchange-related legislation that was reintroduced in 2009 (the Credit Card Interchange Fees Act), a bill that would regulate payment network rules, including the American Express network. No further action was taken on this bill. It is expected that Congressional hearings will continue in 2010 on the interchange issue. The Federal Reserve and various Federal Reserve Banks have been following developments on interchange and have held several conferences focused on interchange rates. While the Federal Reserve has expressed interest in monitoring this issue, it has not indicated the need to regulate interchange rates in the United States.
408. During the last three years, there were also a number of bills proposed in individual state legislatures seeking to impose caps on credit card interchange or to prohibit card companies from charging merchant discount on the sales tax portion of credit card purchases. Other proposals were aimed at increasing the transparency of card network rules for merchants. In addition, a number of bills were proposed to establish merchant liability for the costs of a data security breach of a merchants system or require merchants to adopt technical safeguards to protect sensitive card holder payment information. Proposed state legislation aimed at regulating pricing or other aspects of merchants card acceptance will continue during 2010. In the event that governmental or regulatory activity to limit interchange or merchant fees continues or increases, or state data security legislation is adopted, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. During the last few years as regulatory interest in credit card network pricing to merchants and related issues has increased, the Company has responded to many inquiries from banking and competition authorities throughout the world. For information about our ongoing response to a Civil Investigative Demand from the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, please see Other Matters within Legal Proceedings below.
409. As a significant part of our proprietary Card-issuing business, our U.S. banking subsidiaries, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, issue a wide range of Card products and services to consumers and small businesses in the United States. Our consumer travel business, which provides travel services to Cardmembers and other consumers, complements our core Card business, as does our Global Prepaid business. The proprietary Card business offers a broad set of card products to attract our target customer base. Core elements of our strategy are:
410. focusing on acquiring and retaining high-spending, creditworthy Cardmembers
411. designing Card products with features that appeal to specific customer segments
412. the use of strong incentives to drive spending on our various Card products, including our Membership Rewards®program and other rewards features
413. the use of loyalty programs such as Delta SkyMiles, sponsored by our co-brand and other partners to drive spending
414. the development and nurturing of wide-ranging relationships with co-brand and other partners
415. promoting and using incentives for Cardmembers to use their Cards in new and expanded merchant categories, including everyday spend and traditional cash and check categories
416. providing exceptional customer service.
417. In September, 2009, J.D. Power and Associates released its annual nationwide credit card satisfaction study and ranked American Express highest in overall satisfaction among 21 of the largest card issuers in the United States, for the third consecutive year.
418. We offer individual consumer charge Cards such as the American Express®Card, the American Express®Gold Card, the Platinum Card®, and the ultra-premium Centurion®Card; revolving credit Cards such as Blue from American Express®, Blue Cash®Card from American Express and Blue Sky from American Express; and a variety of Cards sponsored by and co-branded with other corporations and institutions, such as the Delta SkyMiles Credit Card from American Express, True Earnings®Card exclusively for Costco members, Starwood Preferred Guest Credit Card and JetBlue Card from American Express.
419. We have two U.S. bank subsidiaries, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of TRS. Each bank is a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured depository institution. The activities of Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are subject to examination by their respective regulators. Both banks take steps to maintain compliance programs to address the various safety and soundness, internal control and compliance requirements, including anti-money laundering requirements that apply to them. You can find a further discussion of the anti-money laundering initiatives affecting us under Corporate & Other below.
420. Certain additional information regarding each bank is set forth in the table below:
421. Utah-chartered industrial bank
422. Federal savings bank
423. Regulated, supervised and regularly examined by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC
424. Regulated, supervised and regularly examined by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury
425.  Revolving credit cards
426.  Consumer charge cards
427.  All OPEN®credit cards and charge cards
428. Primarily direct mail and other remote marketing channels
429.  Direct mail and other remote marketing channels
430.  In-person selling and third-party co-brand partners
431. Well-capitalized
432. Well-capitalized**
433. The risk-based capital standards for both the FDIC and OTS are substantively identical. A bank generally is deemed to be well capitalized if it maintains a Tier One risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%.
434. Since January 2009, AEBFSB has committed to maintain a Total capital ratio of no less than 15%.
435. Our charge Cards, which generally carry no preset spending limits, are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases of goods or services. Charges are approved based on a variety of factors including a Cardmembers current spending patterns, payment history, credit record, and financial resources. Cardmembers generally must pay the full amount billed each month, and no finance charges are assessed on the balance. Charge Card accounts that are past due are subject, in most cases, to a delinquency
436. assessment and, if not brought to current status, may be cancelled. The no preset spending limit and pay-in-full nature of these products attract high-spending Cardmembers who want to use a charge Card to facilitate larger payments.
437. The charge Cards also offer flexible payment features to Cardmembers. The Sign & Travel®program gives qualified U.S. Cardmembers the option of extended payments for airline, cruise and certain travel charges that are purchased with our charge Cards. The Extended Payment Option offers qualified U.S. Cardmembers the option of extending payment for certain charges on the charge Card in excess of a specified amount.
438. In 2009, we launched two new Card products to the charge Card portfolio. Premier Rewards Gold launched in October, targeting high-spending, frequent travelers who want to maximize rewards. This Card offers triple Membership Rewards®points on airfare purchases, double points on gas and grocery and single points on all other spend. In addition, cardmembers receive 15,000 bonus points when they spend $30,000 in a year. In November, we piloted ZYNC
439. Card from American Express, a new charge Card for a younger demographic with a low annual fee of $25. Cardmembers get core charge Card features and protections on the base card, and have the option of purchasing packs with specialized lifestyle-based features and benefits.
440. During 2009, we launched the Dont Take Chances, Take Charge
441.  marketing campaign, which highlights the benefits of the American Express Charge Card. The campaign is part of an ongoing effort to inform consumers about the charge Card and illustrates how it can help customers, particularly during difficult economic times. Our charge Card products have global breadth, high average spend, lower losses and annual card fees. In addition, at a time when people are looking for financial discipline and value, charge Cards, being a pay-in-full product, allow consumers and companies to control their debt.
442. In another effort to help Cardmembers achieve financial empowerment, we launched the online Money Manager, where Cardmembers can track spend across all of their financial accountsnot just American Express. Cardmembers can set budgets by category and receive alerts to keep them apprised of their spending versus their budget. We also announced a unique, new service that helps American Express®Charge Cardmembers to set, manage, and track spending limits on additional Cards on their account, which is available for anyone who is 15 years of age or older.
443. We offer a variety of revolving credit Cards. These Cards have a range of different payment terms, interest rate and fee structures, rewards programs and Cardmember benefits. Revolving credit Card products, such as Blue from American Express, Blue Cash from American Express and Blue Sky from American Express, provide Card members with the flexibility to pay their bill in full each month or carry a monthly balance on their Cards to finance the purchase of goods or services. Along with charge Cards and co-brand Cards, these revolving credit Cards attract affluent Cardmembers and promote increased relevance for our expanding merchant network. Our non-co-Brand proprietary lending products represent approximately 13% of our US Card Services billings. As we continue to scale back on these Cards and target premium charge Card and co-brand Card products, the Companys priority will be to drive billed business and average spend per card rather than achieve broad growth in cards-in-force.
444. We issue Cards under co-brand agreements with selected commercial firms in the United States. The competition among card issuers and networks for attractive co-brand card partnerships is quite intense because these partnerships can generate high-spending loyal cardholders. The duration of our co-brand arrangements generally ranges from five to ten years. Cardmembers earn rewards provided by the partners respective loyalty programs based upon their spending on the co-brand Cards, such as frequent flyer miles, hotel loyalty points and cash back. We make payments to our co-brand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Cardmember spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. We expense amounts due under co-brand arrangements in the month earned. Payment terms vary by arrangement, but are monthly or quarterly. Generally, once we make
445. payment to the co-brand partner, the partner is solely liable for providing rewards to the Cardmember under the co-brand partners own loyalty program. As the issuer of the co-brand Card, we retain all the credit risk with the Cardmember and bear the receivables funding and operating expenses for such Cards. The co-brand partner retains the risk associated with the miles, points or other currency earned by the Cardmember under the partners loyalty program.
446. During 2009, we extended our exclusive U.S. co-brand partnership with Starwood Hotel and Resorts Worldwide, Inc. and JetBlue for a multi-year period, allowing for the continued expansion of the programs and providing attractive economic and business benefits for both companies. We also unveiled a number of new benefits available on our Delta SkyMiles Credit Cards that allows Cardmembers to earn and redeem miles in more ways and places, on both Delta and Northwest-operated flights. In addition, we also launched a new premium co-branded credit Card called the Hilton HHonors Surpass®Card from American Express, with several enhancements to the existing Hilton HHonors®Card from American Express.
447. We also issue Cards that are marketed under co-brand partnership arrangements with financial services partners. Such partnerships involve the offering of a standard product (issued by TRS or one of its subsidiaries) to customers of the financial services partner, generally co-branded with the partners name on the Card. Under these arrangements, we make payments to the financial services partners that are primarily based on the number of accounts acquired and retained through the arrangement and the amount of Cardmember spending on such Cards. The duration of such arrangements generally ranges from three to seven years.
448. Certain Cards, particularly charge Cards, charge an annual fee that varies based on the type of Card and the number of Cards for each account. We also offer many revolving credit Cards with no annual fee but on which we assess finance charges for revolving balances. Depending on the product, we also charge Cardmembers an annual program fee to participate in the Membership Rewards programs and fees for account performance (e.g., late fees) or for certain services (e.g., additional copies of account statements). We apply standards and criteria for creditworthiness to each Cardmember through a variety of means both at the time of initial solicitation or application and on an ongoing basis during the Card relationship. We use sophisticated credit models and techniques in our risk management operations. For a further description of our risk management policies, please see Risk Management appearing on page 47 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
449. The Membership Rewards program from American Express has over 1,600 redemption partners worldwide. The program allows Cardmembers to earn one point for virtually every dollar charged on eligible, enrolled American Express Cards, and then redeem points for a wide array of rewards, including travel, retail merchandise, dining and entertainment, financial services and even donations to benefit tens of thousands of charities. Points generally have no expiration date and there is no limit on the number of points one can earn. A large majority of spending by eligible Cardmembers earns points under this program.
450. The U.S. Membership Rewards program has over 150 redemption partners and features over 500 merchandise brands. Membership Rewards program tiers are aligned with specific Card products to better meet Cardmember lifestyle and reward program usage needs. American Express Cardmembers participate in one of three Membership Rewards program tiers based on the Credit or Charge Card they have in their wallet. For those Cardmembers with American Express Cards, such as Blue from American Express and ZYNC from American Express, we have the Membership Rewards Express®program. American Express Charge Cardmembers with American Express Green and Gold Cards have the Membership Rewards program. Platinum Card®members and Centurion®Card members are enrolled in the Membership Rewards First®program.
451. During the year we also expanded our list of redemption partners and announced a number of innovations to meet customer demand.
452. We enhanced our Membership Rewards®program with the introduction of new reward options designed to provide cardmembers with greater breadth and variety as well as utility. Specifically, these included: providing Cardmembers the ability to designate their points as payment for everyday charges within their online statement; the launch of the Membership Rewards Specials program featuring specials for popular reward options, including electronics and travel products and services; and the addition of a number of new partners, such as Zappos.Com and British Airways, which give Cardmembers a broader range of opportunities to redeem points with casual dining restaurants, retailers and airlines.
453. When a Cardmember enrolled in the Membership Rewards program uses the Card, we establish reserves to cover the cost of estimated future reward redemptions for points earned to date. When a Membership Rewards program enrollee redeems a reward using Membership Rewards points, we make a payment to the Membership Rewards program partner providing the reward pursuant to contractual arrangements. Membership Rewards expense is driven by Cardmember charge volume, customer participation in the program, and contractual arrangements with redemption partners. At year end, we estimated that current Cardmembers will redeem approximately 90% of their points. For more information on our Membership Rewards Program, see Critical Accounting PoliciesReserves for Membership Rewards Costs appearing on page 24 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
454. Membership Rewards continues to be an important driver of Cardmember spending and loyalty. We believe, based on historical experience, that Cardmembers enrolled in rewards programs yield higher spend, stronger credit performance and greater profit for us. By offering a broader range of redemption choices, we have given our Cardmembers more flexibility in the use of their rewards points and favorably affected our average cost per point. We continually seek to optimize the overall economics of the program and make changes to enhance its value to Cardmembers. Our program is also valuable to merchants that become redemption partners as we bring them high-spending Cardmembers and new marketing channels to reach these Cardmembers.
455. Throughout the world, our Cardmembers have access to a variety of fee-free and fee-based special services and programs, depending on the type of Cards they have. Examples of these special services and programs include:
456.  the Membership Rewards®program
457.  Global Assist®Hotline
458.  Extended Warranty
459.  Car Rental Loss and Damage Insurance Plan
460.  Purchase Protection Plan
461.  Emergency Card Replacement
462.  Return Protection
463.  Manage Your Card Account Online
464.  Online Year-End Summary
465.  American Express Roadside Assistance Services
466.  American Express Bill Pay®
467.  Advanced Ticket Sales
468.  Automatic Flight Insurance
469.  Premium Baggage Protection
470.  CreditSecure®
471.  Account Protector
472.  Online Fraud Protection Guarantee
473.  Credit Card Registry
474.  My Free Credit Score and Report
475.  Identity Theft Assistance
476.  Event Ticket Protection Plan
477.  Platinum Office Program
478.  Online Money Manager
479.  Exclusive Access to Cardmember Events
480. In addition to our U.S. Consumer Card business, through AEBFSB we are also a leading provider of financial services to small businesses (generally, firms with less than 100 employees and/or annual sales up to $10 million). American Express OPEN (OPEN) offers small business owners a wide range of tools, services and savings designed to meet their evolving needs, including:
481. charge and credit cards
482. rewards on eligible spend and business relevant redemptions
483. retail and travel protections such as purchase protection and baggage insurance
484. travel services
485. % - 10% or more discounts at select suppliers of travel, business services, and products through OPEN Savings®
486. expense management reporting
487. enhanced online account management capabilities
488. resources to help grow and manage a business through the community-driven website, OPEN Forum®.
489. All American Express OPEN®Cardmembers are automatically enrolled in OPEN Savings®, a program that offers discounts for all OPEN customers on travel and other major business expenses simply by using their American Express OPEN Card at participating companies. These savings may be combined with any existing discounts or offers. During 2009, American Express OPEN also launched several new initiatives including:
490. a business co-brand with Lowes
491. an integrated online invoicing and electronic payment solution for small businesses
492. OPEN Forum 2.0, with enhancements to our online resource and networking website for small business owners
493. OPEN for Government Contracts: Victory in Procurement
494. (VIP) for Small Business, a national program to help small business owners capitalize on the enormous growth opportunity provided through government contracts.
495. Our proprietary Card business encounters substantial and intense competition in the United States and internationally. As a card issuer, we compete in the United States with financial institutions (such as Citibank, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Capital One Financial) that issue general-purpose charge and revolving credit cards, and Discover Financial Services, which issues the Discover Card on the Discover Business Services network. We also encounter limited competition from businesses that issue their own cards or otherwise extend credit to their customers, such as retailers and airline associations, although these cards are generally accepted only at limited locations. Because of continuing consolidations among banking and financial services companies and credit card portfolio acquisitions by major card issuers, there are now a smaller number of significant issuers. The largest competing issuers have continued to grow, in several cases by acquiring card portfolios, and also by cross-selling through their retail branch networks, and competition among all issuers remains intense.
496. Competing card issuers offer a variety of products and services to attract cardholders, including premium cards with enhanced services or lines of credit, airline frequent flyer program mileage credits, cash rebates and
497. other reward or rebate programs, services for small business owners, teaser promotional interest rates for both credit card acquisition and balance transfers, and co-branded arrangements with partners that offer benefits to cardholders. In recent years we have encountered increasingly intense competition in the small business sector, as competitors have targeted OPENs customer base and our leadership position in providing financial services to small businesses.
498. Most financial institutions that offer demand deposit accounts also issue debit cards to permit depositors to access their funds. Use of debit cards for point-of-sale purchases has grown as most financial institutions have replaced ATM cards with general-purpose debit cards bearing either the Visa or MasterCard logo. As a result, the purchase volume and number of transactions made with debit cards in the United States has grown more rapidly than credit and charge card transactions. Debit cards are marketed as replacements for cash and checks, and transactions made with debit cards are typically for small dollar amounts. The ability to substitute debit cards for credit and charge cards is limited because there is no credit extended and the consumer must have sufficient funds in his or her demand deposit account to pay for the purchase at the time of the transaction as opposed to charge cards where payment is due at the end of the month or credit cards where payment can be extended over a period of time. We do not currently issue point-of-sale debit cards for use on the American Express network.
499. The principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing business include:
500. features and the quality of the services, including rewards programs, provided to Cardmembers
501. the number, spending characteristics and credit performance of Cardmembers
502. the quantity and quality of the establishments that accept Cards
503. the cost of Cards to Cardmembers
504. pricing, payment and other Card account terms and conditions
505. the number and quality of other charge and credit cards available to Cardmembers
506. the nature and quality of expense management data capture and reporting capability
507. the success of targeted marketing and promotional campaigns
508. the ability of issuers to manage credit and interest rate risk throughout the economic cycle
509. the ability of issuers to implement operational and cost efficiencies
510. the quality of customer service.
511. As the payment industry continues to evolve, we are also beginning to face competition from non-traditional players, such as online networks and telecom providers, that leverage new technologies and customers existing charge and credit card account and bank relationships to create payment solutions. In addition, the evolution of payment products in emerging markets may be different than it has been in developed markets. Instead of migrating from cash to checks to plastic, technology and consumer behaviors in these markets may result in the skipping of one or more steps to alternative payment mechanisms such as mobile payments. For a discussion concerning our recent acquisition of Revolution Money Inc. in the emerging payments area, please see Enterprise Growth beginning on page 34 below.
512. The Company meets its funding needs through a variety of sources, including cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash, deposits placed with the Companys U.S. banks, unsecured medium- and long-term notes, asset securitizations, and long-term committed bank borrowing facilities in certain non-U.S. markets.
513. American Express Credit Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of TRS, along with its subsidiaries (Credco), acquires the majority of charge Card receivables arising from the use of corporate Cards issued in the
514. United States and consumer and corporate Cards issued in certain currencies outside the United States. Credco finances the acquisition of receivables principally through the sale of medium- and long-term notes. Centurion Bank and AEBFSB finance their revolving credit receivables and consumer and small business charge card receivables, in part, through the sale of medium-term notes and by offering consumer deposits in the United States. TRS, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB also typically have funded receivables through asset securitization programs. The cost of funding Cardmember receivables and loans is a major expense of Card operations.
515. (You can find a discussion of our securitization and other financing activities on pages 40-43 under the caption Financial Review, and Note 7 on pages87-90 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which portions we incorporate herein by reference.) In addition, please see Difficult conditions in the global capital markets and economy generally, as well as political conditions in the United States and elsewhere, may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations and Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect the Companys ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital in Item 1ARisk Factors below.
516. As an additional source of funding, our banking subsidiaries offer deposits to individuals through brokerage networks as well as directly to consumers. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $26.3 billion in total consumer deposits, a large portion of which was raised through brokerage networks. Our deposit-taking activities compete with other deposit-taking organizations that source deposits through telephone, internet and other electronic delivery channels, brokerage networks, and/or through branch locations. We compete primarily in the deposit markets on the basis of price and our brand reputation for safety and service. We seek to obtain the deposits of new customers as well as existing card customers by offering attractive rates and marketing our name brand.
517. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on capital levels of our bank subsidiaries. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) generally prohibits a bank, including our banking subsidiaries, from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless (1) it is well-capitalized or (2) it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is adequately capitalized generally may not pay an interest rate on any deposit, including direct-to-consumer deposits, in excess of 75 basis points over the national rate published by the FDIC. There are no such restrictions on a bank that is well-capitalized (provided such bank is not subject to a capital maintenance provision within a written agreement, consent order, order to cease and desist, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its federal regulator).
518. The charge card and consumer lending businesses are subject to extensive regulation. In the United States, we are subject to a number of federal laws and regulations, including:
519. the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (which generally prohibits discrimination in the granting and handling of credit)
520. the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACT Act) (which, among other things, regulates use by creditors of consumer credit reports and credit prescreening practices and requires certain disclosures when an application for credit is rejected)
521. the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) (which, among other things, requires extensive disclosure of the terms upon which credit is granted), including the amendments to TILA that were adopted through the enactment of the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act (which mandates certain disclosures on credit and charge card applications)
522. the Fair Credit Billing Act (which, among other things, regulates the manner in which billing inquiries are handled and specifies certain billing requirements)
523. the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (which regulates disclosures and settlement of transactions for electronic funds transfers including those at ATMs)
524. the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the CARD Act) (which prohibits certain acts and practices in connection with consumer credit card accounts)
525. Regulation Z (which was recently amended by the Federal Reserve to extensively revise the open end consumer credit disclosure requirements and to implement the requirements of the CARD Act)
526. federal and state laws and regulations that generally prohibit engaging in unfair and deceptive business practices.
527. Certain federal privacy-related laws and regulations govern the collection and use of customer information by financial institutions (see Corporate & Other below). Federal legislation also regulates abusive debt collection practices. In addition, a number of states, the European Union, and many foreign countries in which we operate have significant consumer credit protection and disclosure and privacy-related laws (in certain cases more stringent than the laws of the United States). Bankruptcy and debtor relief laws affect us to the extent that such laws result in amounts owed being classified as delinquent and/or charged off as uncollectible. As stated above, card issuers and card networks are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to maintaining effective anti-money laundering programs. For a discussion of these and other regulations and legislation that impact our business, please see Supervision & RegulationGeneral within Corporate & Other below.
528. Centurion Bank, AEBFSB and our other bank entities are subject to a variety of laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions. Changes in such laws and regulations or in the regulatory application or judicial interpretation thereof could impact the manner in which we conduct our business and the costs of compliance. The regulatory environment in which our Card and lending businesses operate has become increasingly complex and robust. The U.S. Congress and regulators, as well as various consumer advocacy groups, have continued their focus and attention on certain practices of credit card issuers, such as unfair and deceptive business practices, increases in APRs, changes in the terms of the account, and the types and levels of fees and financial charges charged by card issuers for, among other things, late payments, returned checks, payments by telephone, copies of statements and the like. We regularly review and, as appropriate, refine our business practices in light of existing and anticipated developments in laws, regulations and industry trends so we can continue to manage our business prudently and consistent with regulatory requirements and expectations. For information about the recently enacted CARD Act, please see Privacy and Fair Credit Reporting within Supervision and Regulatory- General below beginning on page42.
529. In June 2009, we announced that Centurion Bank and AEBFSB entered into separate settlement agreements with the FDIC and the OTS, respectively. The settlement agreements related to convenience checks used by certain Cardmembers, which were declined as a result of a change in the Cardmembers risk profile. Among other terms of the settlement agreements, the banks agreed to modify certain practices of their convenience check programs and disclosures and to assist qualifying Cardmembers in the removal of their respective names from any bad check registry or similar database and to refund certain amounts to affected Cardmembers.
530. In January 2003, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (the FFIEC), an interagency body composed of the principal U.S. federal entities that regulate banks and other financial institutions, issued new guidance to the industry on credit card account management and loss allowance practices (the Guidance). The Guidance covers five areas: (i) credit line management; (ii) over-limit practices; (iii) minimum payment and negative amortization practices; (iv) workout and forbearance practices; and (v) certain income (fee) recognition and loss allowance practices. The Guidance is generally applicable to all institutions under the supervision of the federal bank regulatory agencies that comprise the FFIEC, although it is primarily the result of the identification by bank regulators in their examinations of other credit card lenders practices deemed by them to be inappropriate, particularly, but not exclusively, with regard to subprime lending programs. At present, we do not
531. have any lending programs that target the subprime market. Centurion Bank and AEBFSB evaluate and discuss the Guidance with their respective regulators on an ongoing basis as part of their regulatory examination processes, and, as a result, may refine their practices from time to time based on regulatory input. The Guidance has not had, nor do we expect it to have, any material impact on our businesses or practices.
532. The American Express Consumer Travel NetworkUSA provides travel, financial and Cardmember services to consumers through American Express-owned travel service offices, call centers, participating American Express Representatives (independently owned travel agency locations that operate under the American Express brand) and the Consumer Travel Web site. U.S. Consumer Travel has distinguished itself in the luxury marketplace through its Platinum Travel Services and Centurion Travel Services. These services provide programs such as the International Airline Program, which offers special discount fares on certain international first- and business-class tickets, and the Fine Hotels & Resorts program, a luxury hotel program offering room upgrades and value-added amenities. Other premium programs developed by Consumer Travel for Centurion Card and Platinum Card members include the Cruise Privileges Program, Destinations Vacations Program and the Private Jet Services Program. Consumer Travel also provides other value-added programs such as Gold Card Destinations, a collection of travel benefits exclusively for Gold Card members, and Destination Family®, a set of valuable benefits and offers across cruise, tour, hotel, and car rental designed for American Express Card members traveling with families.
533. In addition, the Consumer Travel business operates a wholesale travel business in the United States through our Travel Impressions subsidiary. (A wholesaler purchases inventory, such as hotel rooms, from suppliers and then resells the services to the customer at retail prices that the wholesaler determines.) Our wholesale travel business manages and operates American Express Vacations, which is sold exclusively through the American Express Consumer Travel Network, and distributes travel packages through other retail travel agents and private label brands for third parties in the United States.
534. Our Consumer Travel Web site, americanexpress.com/travel, offers a full range of travel rates and discounts on airfares, hotels, car rentals, last-minute deals, cruises and full vacation packages. The Web site offers unique American Express Cardmember benefits such as an American Express Travel Office locator, Travel Specialist finder tools, double Membership Rewards points, and travel planning resources and destination content through the Local Color portion of the Web site. In addition, Cardmembers are able to Pay With Points by redeeming Membership Rewards points for some categories of travel through our Web site, as well as through our call centers and Travel Offices. The ability to Pay With Points for travel is unique among our competitors and has been well received by our customers.
535. Consumer Travel continues to attract agencies to our Representative Network to increase our network footprint in areas where American Express Cardmembers are concentrated. In 2009, 18 new member agencies joined the Representative Network. Key signings included Altour International, one of the largest travel companies in the United States, and National Travel Center in Charleston, West Virginia, a leading travel management company in the region. Furthermore, in 2009, the Representative Network launched a series of new services allowing Representatives to better service Cardmembers and customers. These services include Pay with Points, AgentPorta Tour and Cruise on-line search engine, and the Hotel Luxury Collectiona value-added hotel program with over 700 properties worldwide. TRS travel network of retail travel locations is important in supporting the American Express brand and providing Cardmember servicing throughout the world.
536. In 2009, we opened a flagship travel service office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which, in addition to providing service from American Express travel agents, offers visitors new services including a Cardmember lounge, concierge services, unique virtual technology and special travel offers and events.
537. American Express Consumer Travel competes with a variety of different competitors including traditional brick and mortar travel agents, credit card issuers offering products with significant travel benefits, online travel agents and travel suppliers that distribute their products to consumers directly via the Internet or telephone-based customer service centers. In recent years we have experienced an increasing presence of niche players that are seeking to capitalize on the growth in the luxury travel segment by combining luxury travel offers with concierge-type services.
538. We issue our charge and credit Cards in numerous countries around the globe. Our geographic scope is widespread and we focus primarily on those markets that we believe offer us the greatest financial opportunity. For a discussion of Cards issued internationally through our GNS partner relationships, please see the section Global Network Services above.
539. The Company continued to bolster its international proprietary Card business through the launch of numerous new or enhanced Card products during 2009. These are Cards that we issue, either on our own or, as further described below, as co-brands with partnering institutions. This past year, among other new proprietary products, we announced or launched Cards with SAS Scandinavian Airlines in Sweden, All Nippon Airways Co., Ltd. in Japan and The Express Rewards Credit Card
540. in the United Kingdom. We offer many of the same programs and services in our international proprietary Card-issuing business as we do in our U.S. proprietary issuing business. For example, as in the United States, we offer various flexible payment options similar to our Sign & Travel®program and our Extended Payment Option to Cardmembers in several international markets.
541. Also, as in the United States, we issue Cards internationally under distribution agreements with banks. Another example of our distribution partnerships is affinity cards with fraternal, professional, educational and other organizations. For instance, we have been successful in penetrating the affinity card segment in Australia, where we issue Cards with the majority of the largest professional associations in that country. In Australia, affinity cards are a substantial part of our total revolving portfolio and contribute to our proprietary consumer lending activities.
542. As in the United States, rewards programs are a strong driver of Cardmember spending in the international consumer business. We have more than 1,500 redemption partners across our international business, with an average of approximately 84 partners in each country; approximately 30% of these partners are in the travel industry. Cardmembers can redeem their points with more than 40 airlines and over 175 hotels. Our redemption options include travel, retail merchandise, entertainment, shopping and recreation gift certificates, experiences, financial services and charity rewards. In 2009, we continued to enhance our rewards programs in several markets, offering more flexible choices that enable Cardmembers to redeem Membership Rewards points more quickly.
543. Membership Travel Services International provides premium travel and concierge services to our Platinum and Centurion Customers, through 24 exclusively dedicated call centers in 23 international countries. Additionally, Membership Travel Services operates 16 proprietary Travel Service Offices in Mexico, Italy and Argentina to provide all Cardmembers with travel and general card service assistance. We also provide foreign exchange services in Mexico and Italy. We have taken steps to enhance our capabilities to sell exclusively negotiated benefits and luxury travel packages with preferred suppliers through the Fine Hotels and Resorts Program, American Express Vacations and American Expresss International Airline Program. Our International Airline Program (IAP), which is exclusively available to Platinum Card and Centurion Card members, allows these Card members to receive complimentary companion tickets or a class upgrade when flying on qualifying international flights in business or first class.
544. We expanded the flexibility of payment for travel and concierge services by allowing International Consumer Cardmembers to use their Membership Rewards points to pay for their travel purchases in 14 international markets.
545. Compared to the United States, consumers outside the United States use general-purpose charge and credit cards for a smaller percentage of their total payments, with some large emerging market countries just beginning to transition to card usage in any meaningful way. Although our geographic scope is widespread, we generally do not have significant share in the markets in which we operate outside the United States. Internationally, our proprietary Card-issuing business is subject to competition from multinational banks, such as Citibank, HSBC and Banco Santander, as well as many local banks and financial institutions. Globally, we view Citibank and HSBC as our strongest competitors, as they currently offer card products in a large number of markets.
546. As discussed elsewhere in this Report, regulators in 2009 continued to introduce a variety of proposed reforms to the payments landscape in a number of our key international markets, some of which have already been adopted. We expect this activity to continue in 2010. Regulators continue to consider developments in the United States and other jurisdictions to help inform and guide their policy. While the nature of the proposals vary, a number of markets have been focused on pricing, disclosure and other card practices and we expect this to continue in 2010.
547. As a consequence, international markets may consider and implement additional card practice regulation in 2010. As we move forward we continue to evaluate our business planning in light of changing market circumstances and the evolving political, economic, regulatory and media environment.
548. In our Global Commercial Services (GCS) segment, we provide expense management services to companies and organizations worldwide through Global Commercial Card and Global Travel Services. American Express is a leading global issuer of commercial cards and is also a leading global travel management company for corporations and businesses. During 2009, we added or retained several major Commercial Card clients in the United States and internationally including Affiliated Computer Services, Inc., International Business Machines Corporation, PepsiCo, Inc., Emerson Electric Co., Stryker, Tri-Pen Management Corporation and UPS. Additionally, in 2009, we added or retained several American Express Business Travel clients in the United States and internationally, including International Business Machines Corporation, Rio Tinto Limited, CBS Corporation, Zurich Insurance Company Ltd, and The Nielsen Company.
549. GCS offers a number of products and services, which include:
550. A comprehensive offering of Corporate Card Programs, such as:
551. Corporate Cards, issued to individuals through a corporate account established by their employer and designed primarily for travel and entertainment (T&E) spending
552. Corporate Meeting Cards, which are provided primarily to corporate meeting planners as a tool to help companies control their meeting and event expenses
553. Business Travel Accounts, centrally billed accounts that companies can use to charge their employees travel expenses.
554. A suite of Business-to-Business Payment Solutions, including:
555. Corporate Purchasing Card, an account established by corporations to pay for everyday business expenses such as office and computer supplies
556. Payment, which provides fast and efficient payment for large-ticket purchases and permits the processing of large transactions with effective fraud controls
557. Buyer Initiated Payment, an electronic solution for companies looking to automate their payment processes.
558. American Express Business Travel, which helps businesses manage and optimize their travel expenses through a variety of travel-related products, services and solutions.
559. Global Commercial Card (GCC) offers a range of expense management solutions to companies worldwide through our Corporate Card Programs and our Business-to-Business Payment Solutions. The American Express®Corporate Card is a charge card that individuals may obtain through a corporate account established by their employer for business purposes. Through our Corporate Card Program, companies can manage their travel, entertainment and purchasing expenses and improve negotiating leverage with suppliers, among other benefits. We use our direct relationships with merchants to offer Corporate Card clients superior data about company spending, as well as streamlined dispute resolution. We issue local currency Corporate Cards in 41 countries and international dollar/euro Corporate Cards in 84 countries. In addition, we provide Corporate Cards issued through our GNS partner relationships for presence in 31 additional countries.
560. With the heightened focus on cost containment, many companies increasingly are interested in our Corporate Meeting Card program, which helps businesses control meeting-related expenses. It allows clients to capture meeting spending, to simplify the payment process, and to gain access to data to support negotiations with suppliers.
561. We also offer a series of Business-to-Business Payment Solutions to help companies manage non-T&E (or B2B) spending. This type of spending by corporations helps to diversify our spend mix beyond travel and entertainment. These solutions provide a variety of benefits to companies including cost savings, process efficiency, improved cash flow and increased visibility, control and security. The Corporate Purchasing Card helps large corporations and mid-sized companies manage their everyday spending. The Corporate Purchasing Card is used to pay for everyday goods and business expenses, such as office supplies, industrial supplies and business equipment in 22 markets around the world.
562. vPayment allows corporate customers to make payments with enhanced controls, data capture and reconciliation capabilities. vPayment offers companies single-use virtual account numbers. Charges are authorized for a specified amount during a specified amount of time. The solution automates reconciliation; eliminates manual check requests; interfaces easily with enterprise resource planning (ERP), procurement and accounts payable systems; and can be used at one or more stages of the procurement-to-payables process.
563. Buyer Initiated Payment allows American Express to pay B2B suppliers electronically on behalf of our clients, permitting them to manage payments, extend their own days payable outstanding or float, and increase their cash on hand. Buyer Initiated Payment has been offered first to clients in the United States and will be offered in other markets around the world in 2011. This solution is best suited for mid- to large-sized companies that want to transition rapidly to electronic payments, reduce supplier inquiries, convert paper to electronic payments, and optimize cash flow.
564. In addition to providing expense management services to large and global corporations, GCC markets Commercial Card programs to middle-market companies (defined in the United States as firms with annual revenues of $10 million to $1 billion worldwide). GCC is focused on continuing to expand its business with mid-sized companies, which represent significant growth opportunities. Businesses of this size often do not have a Commercial Card program. However, once enrolled in a Commercial Card program, mid-sized companies, which usually do not have well-defined purchasing programs, typically put a significant portion of their business spending (both T&E and non-T&E, such as office supplies) on the Commercial Card because they can gain control, savings and employee benefits.
565. American Express also partners with many other companies around the world to offer a number of co-brand corporate Cards in various markets. These products, typically suited for mid-sized companies, provide savings on everyday business spending and /or air travel. To date, American Express has 15 co-brand partnerships
566. worldwide. These include the two new co-brand corporate cards we added in 2009: the SAS American Express Corporate Card in Denmark, Norway and Sweden and the American Express BP Corporate Card in Australia, a unique card program that allows eligible clients to achieve savings and benefits on fuel expenses and on Qantas air travel. GCC offers the Savings at Work®Program to mid-sized companies in the United States, as well as similar programs globally, which provides companies with cash back and/or discounted pricing on everyday business products and services, such as car rentals, hotels, restaurants and courier services. Corporate Cardmembers can also take advantage of our Membership Rewards program to redeem points for air travel and hotel stays, as well as shopping, home, and recreation items. Membership Rewards is a powerful tool for encouraging Card usage and corporate policy complianceleading to greater control and savings.
567. GCC offers American Express @ Work®, a secure, web-based suite of online tools that enables clients to manage their Corporate Card, Corporate Purchasing Card, BTA and Corporate Meeting Card programs on a 24/7 basis through a single user interface. American Express @ Work provides authorized client representatives online access to global management information to help them gain visibility into their spending patterns, as well as the ability to make changes to their program or Commercial Card accounts. American Express @ Work also feeds data to automated expense reporting solutions and includes reconciliation tools that together allow clients to enforce program compliance and effectively integrate spending information with their internal accounting systems. This suite of online tools assists companies in managing expenses more efficiently than offline alternatives, thereby decreasing both the direct and indirect costs associated with maintaining accounts and ensuring program compliance.
568. In the current economic environment, the interest in expense management tools is particularly strong, as clients aim to capture data, analyze trends and make decisions that enhance their cash flow and profitability. Both Visa and MasterCard continue to support card issuers such as U.S. Bank, JPMorgan Chase, and Citibank to build and support data collection and reporting necessary to satisfy customer requirements. Commercial card issuers have increasingly acquired niche technology offerings to enhance data capture capabilities and reporting functionality. Global servicing, data quality, technological functionality and simplicity, and customer experience are among the key competitive factors in the commercial card business.
569. The Global Commercial Card business, which engages in the extension of commercial credit, is subject to more limited regulation than our consumer lending business. In the United States, we are subject to certain of the federal and state laws applicable to our consumer lending business, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the FCRA (as amended by the FACT Act), as well laws that generally prohibit engaging in unfair and deceptive business practices. (For a discussion of this legislation, see Card-Issuing BusinessRegulation.) We are also subject to certain state laws that regulate fees and charges on our products. Additionally, as a global business, we are subject to U.S. state data security and breach notification laws and regulations, as well as significant data protection laws in the European Union and many foreign countries in which we operate. We are also subject to bankruptcy and debtor relief laws that can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us. As discussed above, along with the rest of our business, we are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to maintaining effective anti-money laundering programs. (For a discussion of this legislation and its effect on our business, see Supervision & RegulationGeneral within Corporate & Other below.)
570. Global Travel Services (GTS) consists of American Express Business Travel and Global Foreign Exchange Services. American Express Business Travel (Business Travel) provides globally integrated solutions, both online and offline, to help organizations manage and optimize their travel investments and service
571. their traveling employees. These solutions include travel reservation advice and transaction processing through a global network that is available 24 hours per day; travel expense management policy consultation; meeting management, supplier negotiation and consultation; advisory services; management information reporting, data analysis and benchmarking; and group and incentive travel services.
572. In 2009, we announced, with Maritz Travel, the launch of MaXvantage
573. , an alliance to provide end-to-end strategic meetings management services to support a business entire meeting, event and incentive travel portfolio. We have also launched the CXO Planning Dashboard, which is designed to help senior-level executives make informed, targeted decisions that support revenue generating activities within cost reduction parameters. We also introduced new online initiatives from Business Travel designed to provide companies with enhanced services and increased efficiencies. We continue to update our economic model and invest in new products, services and technologies to enhance the value that we deliver to our customers and address ongoing travel industry challenges and opportunities. For example, we have substantially reduced our reliance on commission revenues from suppliers (such as airlines or hotels), and now generate revenues primarily from customers who pay for the services that we provide.
574. These services include solutions designed to provide our clients with savings, control, services and traveler care. For example, we offer customers savings and benefits through the Preferred Extra
575. supplier value programs and advisory services, which provide preferred supplier rates and consulting solutions in all areas of travel and entertainment expense management.
576. In 2009, we further developed our comprehensive cost-saving travel management offerings, including products such as Recession-Proof Your Travel Investment, a proprietary methodology that allows us to make travel program recommendations to maximize returns. We also established virtual meetings eXpert, an online / offline solution that aggregates both public and private telepresence inventory, makes it accessible to companies so they have a broader pool of virtual meeting options, and delivers the methodology and intelligence necessary to guide travelers to make informed decisions about traveling and potential alternatives. Additionally, we established eXpert insights, a new line that enables clients to benefit from the collective knowledge of numerous consultants and years of travel management experience, as well as gain access to our data repository, through a series of in-depth research reports. We also launched small meetings eXpert, a new online meetings marketplace that reinvents the way users plan and book meetings with fewer than 50 attendees and delivers real-time connection to browse content, compare rates and book guest rooms, meeting space, catering and audio visual equipment. Finally, we grew www.businesstravelconneXion.com, our online community for business travel, to nearly 8,000 members.
577. Business Travel has moved many of its business processes and customer servicing online. In the United States, more than 50% of all Business Travel transactions continue to be processed online. In addition, the volume of online transactions is growing in other markets around the world.
578. Global Foreign Exchange Services (GFES) consists of retail and wholesale foreign exchange services and FX International Payments. Other than in Australia and Singapore, where we operate foreign exchange offices in city locations, we concentrate our retail foreign exchange business in key international airports, for example at London Heathrow in the United Kingdom, Barajas Madrid in Spain and Changi Airport in Singapore. For corporate clients, our FX International Payments online product allows companies and financial institutions to make cross-border payments in major foreign currencies at competitive exchange rates.
579. In 2009, we secured agreements to operate on an exclusive basis at Edinburgh airport in the United Kingdom. We also launched in 2009 our FX International Payments business in New Zealand and increased the global portfolio of active customers to over 10,000 by signing in excess of 2,500 new corporate clients, including 37 financial institutions in the United States.
580. Business Travel continues to face intense competition in the United States and internationally from numerous traditional and online travel management companies, as well as from direct sales by airlines and other travel suppliers. Competition among travel management companies is mainly based on price, service, value creation, convenience, global capabilities and proximity to the customer. Competition also comes from corporate customers themselves, as some companies have become accredited as in-house corporate travel agents.
581. For many years, travel management companies have faced pressure on revenues from airlines, as most carriers have stopped paying base commissions to travel agents for tickets sold and significantly reduced other forms of travel agent compensation. Carriers have also increased the number of transactions they book directly through their Web sites and other means. These trends have reduced the revenue opportunities for travel management companies because they do not receive distribution revenue from directly booked transactions. In recent years, the airline industry has undergone bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events including expanded grants of antitrust immunity to airline alliances. This immunity enables airlines to closely coordinate their international operations and to launch highly integrated joint ventures in transatlantic and other markets. These types of structural changes may result in additional challenges to travel management companies. For additional information concerning these issues, please see Risk FactorsWe have agreements with business partners in a variety of industries, including the airline industry, that represent a significant portion of our business on page78 below.
582. Overall, intense competition among travel management companies, the ongoing trends of increasing direct sales by airlines, the rise of low-cost carriers and ongoing reductions in or elimination of airline commissions and fees, continue to put pressure on revenue for travel agents.
583. Over the last few years we have evolved our business model allowing us to charge customers for the services we provide and the value we create, and restructured our expense base through the rationalization of our call center locations and the transitioning of many of our services online. This restructuring, as well as our global presence, has helped us to balance these revenue pressures. We continue to look for new ways to enhance the value we deliver for our customers both online and offline. Additionally, we are focusing on developing new and innovative products, services and technologies, which enhance the value we deliver to our customers and suppliers and address ongoing travel industry challenges and opportunities.
584. Corporate & Other consists of corporate functions and auxiliary businesses, including the Companys publishing business, Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products, as well as other company operations. We also discuss information relevant to the Company as a whole in this section.
585. We have been in the business of issuing and selling travelers checks since 1891. We sell the American Express®Travelers Cheque (Travelers Cheque or Cheque) as a safe and convenient alternative to cash. Travelers Cheques are currently available in U.S. dollars and four foreign currencies, including Euros. We also issue and sell other forms of paper travelers checks, including American Express®Gift Cheques, which are available in U.S. and Canadian dollars. Sales of Travelers Cheques continued to decline in 2009.
586. In addition to travelers checks, Global Prepaid also offers prepaid gift cards in the United States and Canada, including the American Express®Gift Card, which can be used in the United States and Canada at merchants that accept American Express Cards. On September 30, 2009, American Express announced that it had eliminated all monthly fees on its gift cards, becoming the first open system gift card (i.e., a gift card that can be used at multiple unaffiliated sellers of goods or services) to do so. Sales of gift cards continued to rise in
587. , reflecting the growing popularity of these products and our efforts to increase buying convenience for customers. Global Prepaid also offers a variety of incentive prepaid cards, such as prepaid rebate and reward card products.
588. We sell American Express prepaid products through a variety of channels, including sales directly to customers via phone and the Internet. Travelers Cheques and Gift Cheques are sold primarily through a broad network of selling outlets worldwide, including American Express travel offices, independent travel agents and third-party financial institutions. Gift cards are primarily sold through travel offices and retail establishments, including supermarkets and drug stores.
589. During 2009, we solidified our position as the largest gift card issuer in the United States by signing or renewing distribution deals with a number of large partners, including Simon Malls and General Growth Properties, and we continue to expand the network of retail locations at which our gift card products are sold.
590. Travelers Cheques compete with a wide variety of financial payment products including cash, foreign currency, checks, other brands of travelers checks, debit, prepaid and ATM cards and, in some circumstances, other payment cards. Our prepaid cards compete with the same payment methods, and in particular, with cash, checks and other open-system and store-specific gift cards.
591. The principal competitive factors affecting the travelers check and prepaid card industry are:
592. the number and location of merchants willing to accept the form of payment
593. the availability to the consumer of other forms of payment
594. the amount of fees charged to the consumer
595. the compensation paid to, and frequency of settlement by, selling outlets
596. the accessibility of sales and refunds for the products
597. the ability to service the customer satisfactorily, including for lost or stolen instruments.
598. As an issuer of travelers checks, we are regulated in the United States under the money transmitter or sale of check laws in effect in most states. These laws require travelers check (and, where applicable, prepaid card) issuers to obtain licenses, to meet certain safety and soundness criteria, to hold outstanding proceeds of sale in highly rated and secure investments, and to provide detailed reports. We invest the proceeds from sales of our Travelers Cheques and prepaid cards in accordance with applicable law, predominantly in highly rated debt securities consisting primarily of intermediate- and long-term federal, state and municipal obligations. Many states examine licensees annually. In addition, federal anti-money laundering regulations require, among other things, the registration of traveler check issuers as Money Service Businesses and compliance with anti-money laundering recordkeeping and reporting requirements by issuers and selling outlets. At this time, stored value issuers and redeemers, while considered to be Money Service Businesses, are not required to register under these regulations. Outside the United States, there are varying licensing and anti-money laundering requirements, including some that are similar to those in the United States.
599. Travelers check issuers are required by the laws of many states to comply with state unclaimed and abandoned property laws under which such issuers must pay to states the face amount of any travelers check that is uncashed or unredeemed after 15 years. The abandoned property laws of numerous states also apply to prepaid cards in a variety of ways.
600. In May 2009, the CARD Act amended provisions of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act to impose new restrictions on the terms of gift cards and certain other prepaid cards, including restrictions on the fees that may be charged, expiration dates, and consumer disclosures. Under the CARD Act, the Federal Reserve must promulgate regulations to implements its gift card provisions, which regulations will become effective in August 2010. In addition, a number of states have also enacted laws pertaining to the issuance and the sale of gift cards. We continue to monitor state legislative activity restricting the terms of gift cards. In certain states where regulation continues to restrict fees and has made it unprofitable for us to offer gift cards, we have limited or withdrawn from selling these cards.
601. Through American Express Publishing, we publish luxury lifestyle magazines such as Travel + Leisure®, Food & Wine®and Departures®; travel resources such as SkyGuide®; business resources such as the American Express Appointment Book and SkyGuide Executive Travel, a business traveler supplement; a variety of general interest, cooking, travel, wine, financial and time management books; branded membership services; a growing roster of international magazine editions; as well as directly sold and licensed products. American Express Publishing also has a custom publishing group and is expanding its service-driven Web sites such as: travelandleisure.com, foodandwine.com, departures.com, tlgolf.com, tlfamily.com and eskyguide.com. We have an agreement with Time Inc. under which it manages our publishing business, and we share profits relating to this business.
602. As part of the organizational changes announced in October 2009, management created a new Global Services organization to heighten the companys focus on customer service and to ensure all business operations are managed as effectively and efficiently as possible. We are organizing support functions by process rather than business unit, which the Company expects will streamline costs, reduce duplication of work, better integrate skills and expertise, and improve customer service.
603. Global Services is comprised principally of the following divisions:
604. We have consolidated our U.S. and International service organizations for the first time. Our customer service units have worked over a number of years to ensure outstanding service to customers, while at the same time improving operating margins. As mentioned earlier in this Report, J.D. Power and Associates released its annual nationwide credit card satisfaction study and ranked American Express highest in overall satisfaction among 21 of the largest card issuers in the United States for the third consecutive year.
605. The Global Business Services division is principally comprised of procurement, real estate, human resources processing and financial processing. By consolidating these internal process-driven activities, we will seek to simplify and standardize processes for increased quality, efficiency and cost savings.
606. The Corporate Development Group is responsible for supporting AXP growth and profitability by working with our business units to identify and execute on acquisitions, investments, joint ventures, partnerships and divestitures.
607. We continue to make significant investments, both in the United States and internationally, in our Card systems and infrastructure to allow faster introduction and greater customization of products. We also are using technology to develop and improve our service capabilities to continue to deliver a high quality customer experience. For example, we maintain a service delivery platform that our employees use in the Card business to support a variety of customer servicing and account management activities such as account maintenance, updating of Cardmember information, the addition of new Cards to an account and resolving customer satisfaction issues. In international markets, we are enhancing our global platforms and capabilities, such as in revolving credit.
608. We continue to leverage the Internet to lower costs, improve service quality and enhance our business model. During 2009, we continued to broaden our focus to use the Internet to drive revenue and build our brand, while continuing to migrate transaction volumes at lower costs. We also continue to have more online customer service interactions in the United States than we do by telephone or in person.
609. As of year-end, customers had enrolled approximately 26 million Cards globally in our Manage Your Card Account service. This service enables Cardmembers to review and pay their American Express bills electronically, view and service their Membership Rewards program accounts and conduct various other functions quickly and securely online. We now have an online presence in 23 markets around the world, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, France, Mexico and Japan.
610. We continue to devote substantial resources to our technology platform to ensure the highest level of data integrity, security and privacy. In 2006, we and several other payment card networks formed PCI SSC, an independent standards-setting organization to manage the evolution of technical data security standards. In 2009, we became an owner-member of EMVCo, the standards body that manages, maintains, and enhances specifications for chip-based payment cards and acceptance devices, including point-of-sale terminals. (For a discussion of these organizations, see the Global Merchant Services section above.)
611. In 2002, we outsourced most of our technology infrastructure management and support to IBM. The various arrangements covered under our agreement with IBM range in term from 8 to 12 years, with certain rights to extend. This arrangement currently enables us to benefit from IBMs expertise while lowering our information technology costs. IBM is currently responsible for managing most of our day-to-day technology infrastructure functions, including most of our mainframe and midrange computing systems; Web hosting; database administration; and a portion of our help desk services function. We also outsource other technology infrastructure functions to other third-party service providers. Our internal IT organization continues to retain the Companys key technology competencies, including information technology strategy, information security, managing strategic relationships with technologies partners, data center operations, developing and maintaining applications and databases and managing the technology portfolios of our businesses.
612. As part of the organizational changes, we also are creating a new Enterprise Growth group to leverage existing assets, generate incremental fee revenue and drive our entry into new payment areas and related businesses. The objective for the Enterprise Growth organization is to develop opportunities for growth that transcend individual businesses that take advantage of some of the new technological trends that are emerging across the payments industry.
613. Consistent with our focus on new payments areas, on January 15, 2010, we purchased Revolution Money Inc., a provider of secure person-to-person payment services through an internet based platform, for approximately $300 million. Revolution Moneys online person-to-person payment accounts are FDIC insured and suited for social and instant messaging networks. Additionally, Revolution Money offers the RevolutionCard, a general-use PIN-based card with enhanced security; no name or account number appears on
614. the card and transactions are processed using PIN numbers. We believe Revolution Moneys assets and expertise complement not only our existing payments and processing capabilities, but also provide us with innovative technology and expertise that can help extend our leadership beyond the traditional payments arena.
615. Our existing businesses, as well as our Enterprise Growth Group, are tasked with developing new fee-generating products and services by leveraging our Blue Box resources. Two recently introduced examples of these services from our existing businesses in other segments include:
616. Business Insights, a new business that incorporates analytics and consulting to assist merchants with identifying new trends, enabling product innovation, expanding geographically, and improving the effectiveness of their marketing
617. LoyaltyEdge
618. , a new business line that will assist partners with developing, operating, and improving their own loyalty programs, which includes Delta Airlines as the first customer.
619. American Express Company and TRS are bank holding companies under the BHC Act and have elected to be treated as financial holding companies under the BHC Act. As a bank holding company under the BHC Act, the Company is subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve. Under the system of functional regulation established under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve supervises the Company, including all of its nonbank subsidiaries, as an umbrella regulator of the consolidated organization and generally defers to the primary U.S. regulators of the Companys U.S. depository institution subsidiaries, as applicable, and to the other U.S. regulators of the Companys U.S. non-depository institution subsidiaries that regulate certain activities of those subsidiaries, such as insurance companies regulated by state insurance authorities.
620. Many aspects of our business are also subject to rigorous regulation by other U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by non-U.S. government agencies or regulatory bodies and securities exchanges. Certain of our public disclosure, internal control environment and corporate governance principles are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) and related regulations and rules of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. As a global financial institution, to the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business, we face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts.
621. New laws or regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations (including changes in interpretation or enforcement) could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. More specifically, severe market disruptions in 2008 have led to numerous proposals in the United States and internationally for potentially significant changes in the regulation of the financial services industry. Please see Risk FactorsProposed legislative and regulatory reforms could, if enacted or adopted, result in our business becoming subject to significant and extensive additional regulations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition on pages 70-71 for a further discussion of some of these proposals and their potential impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
622. Federal and state banking laws, regulations and policies extensively regulate the Company, TRS, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, including prescribing standards relating to capital, earnings, liquidity, dividends, the repurchase or redemption of shares, loans or extension of credit to affiliates and insiders, internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, asset growth and impaired assets. Such laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, other customers and the federal deposit insurance funds, as well as to minimize systemic risk, and not for the protection of holders of our
623. securities. Bank regulatory agencies have broad examination and enforcement power over bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, including the power to impose substantial fines, limit dividends, restrict operations and acquisitions and require divestitures. Bank holding companies and banks, as well as subsidiaries of both, are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that the relevant regulatory authority deems unsafe or unsound.
624. The BHC Act limits the nonbanking activities of bank holding companies. Unless a bank holding company has qualified as a financial holding company, its nonbanking activities are restricted to those so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. An eligible bank holding company may elect to be a financial holding company, which is authorized to engage in a broader range of financial activities. A financial holding company may engage in any activity that has been determined by rule or order to be financial in nature, incidental to such financial activity, or (with prior Federal Reserve approval) complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of a depository institution or to the financial system generally. American Express engages in various activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company, including in particular providing travel agency services, acting as a finder and certain insurance underwriting and agency services.
625. For a bank holding company to be eligible for financial holding company status, all of its subsidiary U.S. depository institutions must be well capitalized and well managed and have received at least a satisfactory rating on its most recent Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA) review. If, after becoming a financial holding company and undertaking activities in reliance on such qualification, the company fails to continue to meet applicable capital or managerial standards for financial holding company status, the company must enter into an agreement with the Federal Reserve to comply with applicable capital and managerial standards. Moreover, until all relevant conditions are satisfied, the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates may not, without the Federal Reserves prior approval, commence any additional activities, or acquire control or shares of any company, in reliance on the Companys status as a financial holding company, and the Company must comply with any additional limitations that the Federal Reserve imposes. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may order the company to divest its subsidiary U.S. depository institutions or the company may discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company. If any subsidiary U.S. depository institution fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the CRA, American Express would be subject to substantially the same restrictions on activities and acquisitions as set forth above.
626. The BHC Act requires a bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: (1) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association, if after such acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of any class of the voting securities of the institution; (2) it or any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan association; or (3) it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company.
627. The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended (the Interstate Banking Act), generally permits bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, and preempts all state laws restricting the ownership by a bank holding company of banks in more than one state. The Interstate Banking Act also permits (1) a bank to merge with an out-of-state bank and convert any offices into branches of the resulting bank if both states have not opted out of interstate branching, (2) a bank to acquire branches from an out-of-state bank if the law of the state where the branches are located permits the interstate branch acquisition and (3) banks to establish and operatede novointerstate branches whenever the host state opts-in tode novobranching. Bank holding companies and banks seeking to engage in transactions authorized by the Interstate Banking Act must be adequately capitalized and managed.
628. The Federal Reserve must approve certain additional capital contributions to an existing non-U.S. investment and certain direct and indirect acquisitions by the Company of an interest in a non-U.S. company, including in a foreign bank, as well as the establishment by Centurion Bank of foreign branches in certain circumstances.
629. The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person, entity, or group of persons or entities acting in concert, from acquiring control of a bank holding company such as the Company unless the Federal Reserve has been given prior notice and has not objected to the transaction. Under Federal Reserve regulations, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of the Company would create a rebuttable presumption of acquisition of control of the Company under certain circumstances.
630. In addition, any company is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act before acquiring control of the Company, which, among other things, includes the acquisition of ownership of or control over 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the Company or the power to exercise a controlling influence over the Company. In the case of an acquirer that is a bank or bank holding company, the BHC Act requires approval of the Federal Reserve for the acquisition of ownership or control of any voting securities of the Company, if the acquisition results in the bank or bank holding company controlling more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company.
631. Under Federal Reserve policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of strength to Centurion Bank and to commit capital and financial resources to support it. Such support may be required by the Federal Reserve at times when, absent Federal Reserve policy, we otherwise might determine not to provide it. Capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulator to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
632. The Company, TRS, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking regulators. There are two risk-based measures of capital adequacy for bank holding companies that have been promulgated by the Federal Reserve, as well as a leverage measure.
633. The Company currently calculates its risk-based capital ratios under guidelines adopted by the Federal Reserve, based on the 1998 Capital Accord (Basel I) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee). The risk-based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit and market risk profiles among banks and financial holding companies, to account for off-balance-sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off-balance-sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weights. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance-sheet items.
634. Under Basel I, as adopted by the applicable federal bank regulatory agencies, the minimum guideline for the ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance-sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) is 8%. At least half of the total capital must be composed of Tier 1 capital, which includes common equity, undivided profits, minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries (including, for bank holding companies but not banks, trust preferred securities), non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies (but not banks) a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Tier 2 capital may consist of, among other things, qualifying subordinated debt, mandatorily convertible debt securities, other preferred stock and trust preferred securities and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses. Non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, trust preferred securities and other so-called restricted core capital elements are generally limited to 25% of Tier 1 capital. The minimum guideline for the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets is 4%.
635. In June 2004, the Basel Committee published new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital (Basel II). In December 2007, the U.S. bank regulatory agencies jointly adopted a final rule based on Basel II. The Company, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are required now to transition to the Basel II-based guidelines, absent a waiver. The final rule provides for a series of three transitional periods during which the Company must calculate its risk-based capital ratios under both the Basel I-based guidelines and the new Basel II-based guidelines, with the minimum capital requirements during the transitional periods being the greater of the required capital as calculated under the final rule and a designated percentage of required capital as calculated under Basel I. Prior to beginning the three transitional periods, we must complete a satisfactory parallel-run period of no less than four consecutive calendar quarters during which we will be required to confidentially report regulatory capital under both the Basel I and Basel II regulations. Under the final rule, we must adopt a board of directors-approved implementation plan for Basel II and begin the first transitional period for capital calculation under the final rule no later than January 1, 2013, unless this time is extended by the Federal Reserve.
636. In addition, the Federal Reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (the Leverage Ratio), of 3% for bank holding companies that meet certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating. All other bank holding companies generally are required to maintain a Leverage Ratio of at least 4%. The guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will consider a tangible Tier 1 capital leverage ratio (deducting all intangibles) and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities.
637. As a supervisory matter, federal bank regulatory agencies expect most bank holding companies, and in particular larger bank holding companies such as the Company, to maintain regulatory capital ratios that, at a minimum, qualify a bank holding company and its depository institution subsidiaries as well capitalized. The required ratios to qualify as well capitalized are a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%. Following the recent financial crisis, the federal bank regulatory agencies have encouraged larger bank holding companies to maintain capital ratios appreciably above even the well-capitalized standard. Moreover, the Federal Reserve is focusing more on the regulatory requirement that common equity be the predominant element of Tier 1 capital. In addition, the Federal Reserve has assessed the capital adequacy of the countrys 19 largest bank holding companies, including the Company, under a so-called stress test relating primarily to loan quality.
638. For information regarding our capital ratios, please see Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity on pages39-40 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
639. In December 2009, the Basel Committee issued two consultative documents proposing reforms to bank capital and liquidity regulation. The Basel Committees capital proposals would significantly revise the definitions of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Among other things, they would: (i) re-emphasize that common equity is the predominant component of Tier 1 capital by (a) adding a minimum common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio, with the ratio itself to be determined based on the outcome of an impact study that the Basel Committee is conducting, and (b) requiring that goodwill, general intangibles and certain other items that currently must be deducted from Tier 1 capital instead be deducted from common equity as a component of Tier 1 capital; (ii) disqualify innovative capital instruments  including U.S.-style trust preferred securities and other instruments that effectively pay cumulative dividends  from Tier 1 capital status; (iii) strengthen the risk coverage of the capital framework, particularly with respect to counterparty credit risk exposures arising from derivatives, repos and securities financing activities; (iv) introduce a leverage ratio requirement as an international standard; and (v) implement measures to promote the build-up of capital buffers in good times that
640. can be drawn upon during periods of stress, introducing a countercyclical component designed to address the concern that existing capital requirements are procyclical  that is, they encourage reducing capital buffers in good times, when capital could more easily be raised, and increasing capital buffers in times of distress, when access to capital markets may be limited or they may effectively be closed. The capital proposals do not specify a percentage for the new ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets or changes in the current minimum Tier 1 capital and total capital risk-based capital requirements, which currently are 4% and 8%, respectively. Instead, they state that the minimum percentage requirements for the new ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets and the other capital ratiosincluding Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, total capital to risk-weighted assets and the new leverage ratiowill be included in a fully calibrated, comprehensive set of capital and liquidity proposals to be released by December 31, 2010. Independently, in September 2009, the Department of the Treasury issued a policy statement titled Principles for Reforming the U.S. and International Regulatory Capital Framework for Banking Firms setting forth core principles intended to address many of the same substantive items as the Basel Committee capital proposals and specifically calling for increased capital requirements for financial institutions, and substantially heightened capital requirements for large financial institutions.
641. If implemented, the Basel Committees liquidity proposals, although apparently similar in many respects to tests historically applied by banking organizations and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, would for the first time be formulaic and required by regulation. They would impose two measures of liquidity risk exposure, one based on a 30-day time horizon and the other addressing longer-term structural liquidity mismatches over a one-year time period.
642. The Basel Committee indicated that it expects final provisions responsive to the proposals to be implemented by December 31, 2012. Ultimate implementation in individual countries, including the United States, is subject to the discretion of the bank regulators in those countries. The Basel Committees final proposals may differ from the proposals released in December 2009, and the regulations and guidelines adopted by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the Company and our subsidiaries may differ from the final accord of the Basel Committee. Moreover, although some aspects of the Basel Committee proposals were quite specific (e.g., the definition of the components of capital), others were merely conceptual (e.g., the description of the leverage test) and others not specifically addressed (e.g., the minimum percentages for required capital ratios). We are not able to predict at this time the content of guidelines or regulations that will ultimately be adopted by regulatory agencies having authority over the Company and our subsidiaries or the impact of changes in capital and liquidity regulation upon us. However, a requirement that the Company and our depository institution subsidiaries maintain more capital, with common equity as a more predominant component, or manage the configuration of their assets and liabilities in order to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements, could significantly impact our return on equity, financial condition, operations, capital position and ability to pursue business opportunities.
643. The FDIA requires, among other things, that federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action in respect of FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA specifies five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. A depository institutions capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. A bank may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. Once an institution becomes undercapitalized, the FDIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified. A depository institution that is not well capitalized is also subject to certain limitations on brokered deposits and Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service deposits. The vast majority of the Companys U.S. retail deposits have to date been raised through broker channels. For a description of our deposit programs, please see Deposit Programs beginning on page 23 above and Deposit Programs on page 42 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
644. The FDIA generally prohibits an FDIC-insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of dividends) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve and to growth limitations, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. For a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, any holding company must guarantee the capital plan up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institutions assets at the time it became undercapitalized and the amount of the capital deficiency at the time it fails to comply with the plan. In the event of the holding companys bankruptcy, such guarantee would take priority over claims of its general unsecured creditors. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized.
645. Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator.
646. The Company and TRS as well as Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are limited by banking statutes and regulations in their ability to pay dividends. In general, federal and applicable state bank laws prohibit, without first obtaining regulatory approval, insured depository institutions, such as Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. In addition to specific limitations on the dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies, federal regulators could prohibit a dividend that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.
647. It is Federal Reserve policy that bank holding companies should generally pay to common shareholders dividends on common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organizations current and expected future capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Moreover, bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that place undue pressure on the capital of depository institution subsidiaries or that may undermine the bank holding companys ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve could prohibit a dividend by the Company or TRS that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.
648. Certain transactions (including loans and credit extensions from Centurion Bank and AEBFSB) between Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, on the one hand, and their affiliates (including the Company, TRS and their non-bank subsidiaries), on the other hand, are subject to quantitative and qualitative limitations, collateral requirements, and other restrictions imposed by statute and Federal Reserve regulation. Transactions subject to these restrictions are generally required to be made on an arms-length basis. These restrictions generally do not apply to transactions between a depository institution and its subsidiaries.
649. Centurion Bank and AEBFSB accept deposits, and those deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits. The FDICs deposit insurance fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions, which depend on the risk category of an institution and the amount of insured deposits that the institution holds. The FDIC may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi-annual basis. Furthermore,
650. assessment rates are subject to adjustments based upon the insured depository institutions ratio of (1) long-term unsecured debt to domestic deposits, (2) secured liabilities to domestic deposits, and (3) brokered deposits to domestic deposits (if greater than 10%).
651. As part of its efforts to rebuild the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC adopted a rule imposing a special assessment of five basis points on each FDIC-insured depository institutions assets, minus its Tier 1 capital, as of June 30, 2009. This special assessment was collected on September 30, 2009. Additionally, also as part of its efforts to rebuild the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC required insured depository institutions, including Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, to prepay their estimated assessments for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012 on December 30, 2009. The prepaid assessment amount for our insured depository institution subsidiaries totaled approximately $95.2 million, $6.7 million of which was recorded as an expense for income statement purposes in 2009 and $88.5 million of which was recorded as a prepaid expense for balance sheet purposes as of December 31, 2009. Also as part of its efforts to rebuild the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC recently adopted a rule implementing a uniform increase of three basis points for assessment rates, effective January 1, 2011.
652. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institutions deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
653. If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution, such as Centurion Bank or AEBFSB, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has the power: (1) to transfer any of the depository institutions assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institutions creditors; (2) to enforce the terms of the depository institutions contracts pursuant to their terms; or (3) to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution.
654. In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution, including claims of debt holders of the institution and depositors in non-U.S. offices, in the liquidation or other resolution of the institution by a receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of Centurion Bank or AEBFSB, the debt holders would be treated differently from, and could receive substantially less, if anything, than the depositors in U.S. offices of the depository institution.
655. Under the cross-guarantee provision of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), insured depository institutions, such as Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, may be liable to the FDIC with respect to any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or FDIC assistance to, any commonly controlled insured depository institution. Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are commonly controlled within the meaning of the FIRREA cross-guarantee provision.
656. Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Under the terms of the CRA, the primary federal regulator of a depository institution is required, in connection with its examination of the depository institution, to assess such depository institutions record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that depository institution, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Furthermore, such assessment is also required of any depository institution that has applied to,
657. among other things, merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of a federally regulated financial institution or to open or relocate a branch office. In the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or bank holding company, the Federal Reserve will assess the record of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant bank holding company in considering the application. In addition, as discussed previously, the failure of the Companys subsidiary depository institutions to maintain satisfactory CRA ratings could result in restrictions on the Companys and TRS ability to engage in activities in reliance on financial holding company authority.
658. We use information about our customers to develop and make available relevant, personalized products and services. Certain customers are given choices about how we use and disclose their information, and we give them notice regarding the measures we take to safeguard this information. Regulatory activity in the areas of privacy and data security continues to increase worldwide, spurred by advancements in technology and related concerns about the rapid and widespread dissemination and use of information. As noted above, as part of our efforts to enhance payment account data security, in 2006, we and several other payment card networks formed PCI SSC, an independent standards-setting organization to manage the evolution of the PCI Data Security Standard, which helps organizations that process card payments to prevent credit/charge card security breaches and fraud through increased controls around data and its exposure to compromise.
659. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) became effective on July 1, 2001. GLBA requires consumer notice of a financial institutions privacy policies and practices and affords customers the right to opt out of the institutions disclosure of their personal financial information to unaffiliated third parties (with limited exceptions). This legislation does not preempt state laws that afford greater privacy protections to consumers, and several states have adopted such legislation. For example, in 2003 California enacted that states Financial Information Privacy Act. As noted elsewhere in this Report, we are also subject to the FCRA, which, among other things, places restrictions (with limited exceptions) on the sharing and use of certain personal financial information of our customers with and by our affiliates.
660. In addition, various federal banking regulatory agencies, and as many as 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, have enacted security breach laws and regulations, requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach. Data breach laws are also becoming more prevalent in other parts of the world where we operate, including Japan, Mexico and Germany. In many countries that have yet to impose automatic data breach notification requirements, regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage data breaches.
661. Beyond these data breach laws, a growing number of states, including Massachusetts and Nevada, have adopted broad-ranging data security regulations regarding the protection of customer and employee data that could result in higher compliance and technology costs for the Company. In 1995, the European Parliament and Council passed European Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (commonly referred to as the Data Protection Directive), which obligates the controller of an individuals personal data to, among other things, take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.
662. We continue our efforts to safeguard the data entrusted to us in accordance with applicable law and our internal data protection policies, including taking steps to reduce the potential for identity theft, while seeking to collect and use data properly to achieve our business objectives.
663. In May 2009, the CARD Act was enacted to prohibit certain practices for consumer credit card accounts. The CARD Act, among other requirements, prohibits issuers from treating a payment as late for any purpose, including increasing the annual percentage rate or imposing a fee, unless a consumer has been provided a reasonable amount of time to make the payment. It also requires issuers to apply payment amounts in excess of the minimum payment first to the balance with the highest APR and then to balances with lower APRs. In
664. addition, the Act prohibits an issuer from increasing the APR on outstanding balances, except in limited circumstances such as when a promotional rate expires, a variable rate adjusts, or an account is seriously delinquent or completes a workout arrangement. These requirements became effective on February 22, 2010.
665. Also, beginning on February 22, 2010, issuers must maintain reasonable written policies to consider a consumers income or assets and current obligations prior to opening an account or increasing a credit line. This may require adjustments to our account opening decisioning and line increase decisioning processes. This is not expected to have any significant impact on these decisions  if anything it could result in fewer applications for new accounts being accepted or fewer requests for line increases being approved. In addition, applicants for new accounts who are under the age of 21 must demonstrate an independent ability to make the required minimum periodic payments. This may decrease the number of applications that are approved for applicants under the age of 21.
666. The Act also requires that penalty fees be reasonable and proportional, and that issuers review recent APR increases periodically to determine if a decrease is appropriate. These provisions become effective on August 22, 2010. Since the Federal Reserve has not yet published final rules implementing these provisions, it is difficult to assess the potential impact these requirements may have on our operations.
667. The Federal Reserve also amended its rules on the format and content of consumer credit card disclosures. The amendments require revisions to the format and content of all main types of open-end consumer credit disclosures, including applications and solicitations, account-opening disclosures, and periodic billing statements. These amendments become effective on July 1, 2010. While the Company is making certain changes to its product terms and practices that are designed to mitigate the impact of the changes required by the CARD Act, there is no assurance that it will be successful. The long-term impact of the CARD Act on the Companys business practices and revenues will depend upon a number of factors, including its ability to successfully implement its business strategies, consumer behavior and the actions of the Companys competitors, which are difficult to predict at this time. If the Company is not able to lessen the impact of the changes required by the CARD Act, it will have a material adverse effect on results of operations.
668. The Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (FCRA) regulates the disclosure of consumer credit reports by consumer reporting agencies and the use of consumer credit report information by banks and other companies. FCRA was significantly amended by the enactment in December 2003 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (the FACT Act). The FACT Act requires any company that receives information concerning a consumer from an affiliate, subject to certain exceptions, to permit the consumer to opt out from having that information used to market the companys products to the consumer. In November 2007, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule implementing the affiliate marketing provisions of the FACT Act. Companies subject to oversight by these agencies were required to comply with the rules by October 1, 2008. We qualify for an exception from the affiliate marketing provisions of the FACT Act, and as a result, we do not need to provide an affiliate marketing opt out. The FACT Act further amends the FCRA by adding several new provisions designed to prevent or decrease identity theft and to improve the accuracy of consumer credit information. The federal banking agencies and the FTC published a final rule in November 2007 requiring financial institutions to implement a program containing reasonable policies and procedures to address the risk of identity theft and to identify accounts where identity theft is more likely to occur. Companies subject to oversight by the federal banking agencies originally were required to comply with the rule by November 1, 2008, but the FTC has stated it will suspend enforcement of its rule until June 1, 2010. TRS continues to be regulated by the FTC with respect to this new rule and is currently evaluating what steps it will need to take to comply. The FACT Act also imposes new duties on both consumer reporting agencies and on businesses that furnish or use information contained in consumer credit reports. For example, a furnisher of information is required to implement procedures to prevent the reporting of any information that it learns is the result of identity theft. Also, if a consumer disputes the accuracy of information provided to a consumer reporting agency, the furnisher of that information must conduct an investigation and respond to the consumer in a timely fashion. The federal banking regulatory agencies and the FTC have issued rules that specify the circumstances under which furnishers of information would be
669. required to investigate disputes regarding the accuracy of the information provided to a consumer reporting agency. The FACT Act also requires grantors of credit that use consumer credit report information in making a determination to offer a borrower credit on terms that are materially less favorable than the terms offered to most of the lenders other customers to notify the borrower that the terms are based on a consumer credit report. In such a case the borrower is entitled to receive a free copy of the report from the consumer reporting agency. The federal bank regulatory agencies and the FTC have issued rules that specify the circumstances under which risk-based pricing notices must be provided to customers and the content, format and timing of such notices. Grantors of credit using prescreened consumer credit report information in credit solicitations are also required to include an enhanced notice to consumers that they have the right to opt out from receiving further prescreened offers of credit. The enactment of the FACT Act and the promulgation of rules implementing it are not expected to have a significant impact on our business or practices.
670. In the United States, the USA Patriot Act was enacted in October 2001 in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The Patriot Act, in addition to substantially broadening existing anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing legislation, amended the Bank Secrecy Act, the primary legislation governing AML requirements. The Patriot Act contains a wide variety of provisions aimed at fighting terrorism and money laundering, including provisions aimed at impeding terrorists ability to access and move funds used in support of terrorist activities. Among other things, the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, requires financial institutions to establish AML programs that meet certain standards, including, in some instances, expanded reporting and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements. While American Express has long maintained AML programs in our businesses, certain of our business activities are subject to specific AML regulations that prescribe minimum standards for components of the AML programs. For example, our GNS business maintains a risk-based program to ensure that institutions that are licensed to issue cards or acquire merchants on their networks maintain adequate AML controls. We have also developed and implemented a Know Your Customer, or due diligence, program and an enhanced due diligence program, including a program for verifying the identity of our customers (Customer Identification Program) for applicable businesses. We will take steps to comply with any additional regulations or initiatives that are adopted, whether in the United States or in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business.
671. Over the last several years, the industry has seen increased regulatory scrutiny of the AML compliance programs of financial institutions, with emphasis on record keeping and reporting requirements such as the requirement to identify and report suspicious activity, leading to enforcement actions for non-compliance. To meet this increased scrutiny, we continue to enhance our enterprise-wide AML compliance program. Our AML compliance programs primarily consist of risk-based policies, procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to prevent, detect and report money laundering.
672. We have significant operations in the European Union, including a number of regulated businesses. We monitor developments in EU legislation, as well as in the other markets in which we operate, to ensure that we are in a position to comply with all applicable legal requirements, including European Union directives applicable to payment institutions, credit providers, insurance intermediaries and other financial institutions.
673. Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve. In October 2009, the Federal Reserve issued a comprehensive proposal on incentive compensation policies that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve, including bank holding companies such as American Express. The proposal sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage excessive risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations. The three principles provide that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the
674. organizations ability to effectively identify and manage risks, be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance. Any deficiencies in compensation practices of a banking institution that are identified by the Federal Reserve in connection with its review of such organizations compensation practices may be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The proposal provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. Separately, the FDIC has solicited comments on whether to amend its risk-based deposit insurance assessment system to potentially increase assessment rates on financial institutions with compensation programs that put the FDIC deposit insurance fund at risk, and proposed legislation would subject compensation practices at financial institutions to heightened standards and increased scrutiny.
675. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of American Express and its subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate its and their key employees.
676. Our international operations are subject to U.S. laws governing the activities of U.S. companies transacting business abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA). The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies from making improper payments, or offers of payments, to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also requires us to comply with certain accounting standards, which are enforced by the SEC. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. We have implemented safeguards to deter prohibited practices; however, if our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws governing our international operations, we may face investigations or prosecutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
677. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from the use of our Card products, Travelers Cheques, travel and other financial products and services in countries outside the United States and continue to broaden the use of these products and services outside the United States. (For a discussion of our revenue by geographic region, see Note 25 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which you can find on pages 122-124 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders and which is incorporated herein by reference.) Our revenues can be affected by political and economic conditions in these countries (including the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by the local Card issuer of obligations arising out of local Cardmembers spending outside such country, for the payment of Card bills by Cardmembers who are billed in other than their local currency, and for the remittance of the proceeds of Travelers Cheque sales). Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Cardmembers currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the Card in connection with spending outside the local country.
678. As a result of our foreign operations, we are exposed to the possibility that, because of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar may be realized in amounts greater or less than the U.S. dollar amounts at which they are currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Examples of transactions in which this may occur include the purchase by Cardmembers of goods and services in a currency other than the currency in which they are billed; the sale in one currency of a Travelers Cheque denominated in a second currency; and, in most instances, investments in foreign operations. These risks, unless properly monitored and managed, could have an adverse effect on our operations. For more information on how we manage risk relating to foreign exchange, see Risk ManagementMarket Risk Management Process on pages 47-49 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
679. On September 18, 2007, we entered into an agreement to sell our international banking subsidiary, American Express Bank Ltd. (AEBL), to Standard Chartered PLC (Standard Chartered), and to sell American Express International Deposit Company (AEIDC) through a put/call agreement to Standard Chartered 18 months after the close of the AEBL sale. The sale of AEBL was completed on February 29, 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, AEIDC qualified to be reported as a discontinued operation and the sale of AEIDC was completed on September 10, 2009.
680. For all periods presented, all of the operating results, assets and liabilities, and cash flows of AEBL (except for certain components of AEBL that were not sold) and AEIDC have been removed from the Corporate & Other segment and are presented separately in discontinued operations in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements have been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations unless otherwise noted.
681. You can find more information regarding this transaction on page 21 under caption Financial Review and in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, appearing on page 76 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which are incorporated herein by reference.
682. You can find information regarding the Companys reportable operating segments, geographic operations and classes of similar services in Note 25 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears on pages 122-124 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which Note is incorporated herein by reference.
683. Set forth below in alphabetical order is a list of all our executive officers as of February 25, 2010. None of our executive officers has any family relationship with any other executive officer, and none of our executive officers became an officer pursuant to any arrangement or understanding with any other person.

This information excludes discontinued operations unless otherwise noted.
724. The following tables provide a summary of the Companys consolidated average balances including major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities along with an analysis of net interest earnings. Consolidated average balances, interest, and average yields are segregated between U.S. and non-U.S. offices. Assets, liabilities, interest income and interest expense are attributed to U.S. and non-U.S. based on location of the office recording such items.

740. Amounts include (i) average interest-bearing restricted cash balances of $417 million, $214 million, and $293 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and (ii) the associated interest income.
741. Average balances in 2007 include negative cash balances not reclassified to liabilities which also could not be segregated between U.S. and non-U.S. As a result, the average yield on interest-bearing deposits in other banks has not been shown for 2007 as it would not be meaningful (n.m.).
742. Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current presentation.
743. Card fees related to cardmember loans included in interest income were $107 million, $95 million, and $90 million in U.S. and $79 million, $51 million and $40 million in non-U.S. for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
744. Average non-accrual loans were included in the average loan balances used to determine the average yield on loans in amounts of $554 million, $8 million and $34 million in U.S. as well as $15 million, $6 million and $5 million in non-U.S. for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
745. Average yields for available-for-sale investment securities have been calculated using total amortized cost balances and do not include changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. Average yield on non-taxable investment securities is calculated on a tax-equivalent basis using the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent.
746. Amounts include (i) average equity securities balances, which are included in investment securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and (ii) the associated dividend income. The average yield on other assets has not been shown as it would not be meaningful.

760. Amounts include (i) average deferred compensation liability balances which are included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and (ii) the associated interest expense. The average rate on other liabilities has not been shown as it would not be meaningful.
761. Net average yield on interest-earning assets is defined as net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets as adjusted for the items mentioned in note (g) on page 50.
762. The following table presents the amount of changes in interest income and interest expense due to changes in both average volume and average rate. Major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have been segregated between U.S. and non-U.S. offices. Average volume/rate changes have been allocated between the average rate and average volume variances on a consistent basis based upon the respective percentage changes in average balances and average rates.

784. The following table presents an analysis of remaining contractual maturities and weighted average yields for available-for-sale investment securities. Yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a tax-equivalent basis as discussed earlier.
785. December 31,(Millions, except percentages)
786. Mortgage-backed securities (a)
787. Retained subordinated securities (b)
788. The expected payments on state and municipal obligations and mortgage-backed securities may not coincide with their contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations.
789. The Companys individual investments in the unrated classes of its retained subordinated securities contain multiple maturity dates over periods ranging from 2010 through 2018. Accordingly, in the table above, the Company has classified such investments based on the weighted-average maturity.
790. Excludes equity securities and other securities included in the prior table above as these are not debt securities with contractual maturities.
791. Average yields for available-for-sale investment securities have been calculated using the effective yield on the date of purchase.
792. As of December 31, 2009, other than U.S. Government treasury and agency obligations, the Companys holdings in the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) with a book value of $3.6 billion were the only investments that exceeded 10 percent of shareholders equity. The securities issued by the Lending Trust consist of investments in retained subordinated securities from the Companys cardmember loan securitization program.
793. The following table presents gross loans, net of unearned income, and gross cardmember receivables by customer type segregated between U.S. and non-U.S., based on the domicile of the borrowers. Allowance for losses is presented beginning on page 60. Refer to Note 4, Accounts Receivable on page 80 and Note 5, Loans on page 82 in the Annual Report for additional information.
794. Cardmember (a)
795. Consumer (c)
796. Commercial (d)
797. Represents loans to individual and small business consumers.
798. Other loans at December 31, 2009 and 2008 primarily represent small business installment loans, a store card portfolio whose billed business is not processed on the Companys network, and small business loans associated with the acquisition of Corporate Payment Services. Other loans at December 31, 2008, also included a loan to an affiliate in discontinued operations. 2007 and prior periods primarily represent small business installment loans.
799. Represents receivables from individual and small business charge card consumers.
800. Represents receivables from corporate charge card clients.
801. The following table presents contractual maturities of loans and cardmember receivables by customer type and segregated between U.S. and non-U.S. borrowers, and distribution between fixed and floating interest rates for loans due after one year based upon the stated terms of the loan agreements.
802. Loans due after one year at fixed interest rates
803. Loans due after one year at variable interest rates
804. Cardmember loans have no stated maturity and are therefore included in the due within one year category. However, many of the Companys cardmembers will revolve their balances, which may extend their repayment period beyond one year for balances due at December 31, 2009.
805. Cardmember receivables are immediately due upon receipt of cardmember statements and have no stated interest rate and are included within the due within one year category. Receivables due after one year represent long-term modification programs or Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDR), wherein the terms of a receivable have been modified for cardmembers that are experiencing financial difficulties and a long-term concession (more than 12 months) has been granted to the borrower.
806. Cardmember and other loans due after one year primarily represent installment loans and approximately $51 million of TDRs.
807. The following table presents the Companys exposure to any concentration of gross cardmember loans and cardmember receivables which exceeds 10 percent of total cardmember loans and cardmember receivables. Cardmember loan and cardmember receivable concentrations are defined as cardmember loans and cardmember receivables due from multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause these borrowers to be impacted similarly to certain economic or other related conditions.
808. Individuals
809. Commercial (b)
810. Refer to Note 22, Significant Credit Concentrations on page 118 in the Annual Report for additional information on concentrations, including those from airlines and for a discussion of how the Company manages concentration exposures. Certain distinctions between categories require management judgment.
811. Includes corporate charge card receivables of $513 million from financial institutions, $12 million from U.S. Government agencies and $9.3 billion from other corporate institutions.
812. Because charge card products have no preset spending limit, the associated credit limit on cardmember receivables is not quantifiable. Therefore, the quantified unused line-of-credit amounts only include the approximate credit line available on cardmember loans (including both for on-balance sheet loans and loans previously securitized).
813. The following table presents the amounts of non-performing loans and cardmember receivables that are either non-accrual, past due, or restructured, segregated between U.S. and non-U.S. borrowers. Past due loans are loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments. Restructured loans and cardmember receivables are those that meet the definition of Troubled Debt Restructurings.
814. The Companys policy is generally to cease accruing interest income once a related cardmember loan is 180 days past due at which time the cardmember loan is written off. The Company establishes loan loss reserves for estimated uncollectible interest receivable balances prior to write-off. Beginning with 2009, certain cardmember loans placed with outside collection agencies are put on non-accrual status.
815. As of December 31, 2009, these amounts primarily include certain cardmember loans placed with outside collection agencies. Non-accrual loans at December 31, 2006 and 2005 included a single loan to a U.S. commercial airline of approximately $104 million and $266 million, respectively, which was paid off in full during the second quarter of 2007. The loan was put on non-accrual status in the third quarter of 2005.
816. Represents long-term modification programs or TDR, wherein the terms of a loan or receivable have been modified for cardmembers that are experiencing financial difficulties and a long-term concession (more than 12 months) has been granted to the borrower. The Company may modify cardmember loans and receivables and such modifications may include reducing the interest rate/delinquency fees on the loans and receivables and/or placing the cardmember on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. If the cardmember does not comply with the modified terms, then the loan or receivable agreement reverts back to its original terms. In addition to TDRs, the Company has instituted other modification programs that include short-term (12 months or less) interest rate and fee reductions to cardmembers experiencing financial difficulty (Short Term Modification Programs). As of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, approximately $701 million, $497 million and $0, respectively, in cardmember loans and receivables have been modified under these Short Term Modification Programs and are not included in the schedule above, except for $46 million, $69 million and $0, respectively, which are included within loans contractually 90 days past due and still accruing interest.
817. The following table presents the gross interest income for both non-accrual and restructured loans for 2009 that would have been recognized if such loans had been current in accordance with their original contractual terms, and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for only part of 2009. The table also presents the interest income related to these loans that was actually recognized for the period. These amounts are segregated between U.S. and non-U.S. borrowers.
818. Gross amount of interest income that would have been recorded in accordance with the original contractual terms (a)
819. Interest income actually recognized
820. Based on the contractual rate that was being charged at the time the loan was restructured or placed on non-accrual status.
821. This disclosure presents outstanding amounts as well as specific reserves for certain receivables where information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms. At December 31, 2009, the Company did not identify any potential problem loans or receivables within the cardmember loans and receivables portfolio that were not already included in Risk Elements above.
822. Cross-border disclosure is based upon the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Councils (FFIEC) guidelines governing the determination of cross-border risk. The Company has adopted the FFIEC guidelines for its cross-border disclosure starting with 2009 reporting. Accordingly, the amounts for 2008 and 2007 have been revised from the previously reported amounts to conform to the current presentation.
823. The primary differences between the FFIEC and Guide 3 guidelines for reporting cross-border exposure are: i) available-for-sale investment securities are reported based on amortized cost for FFIEC instead of fair values for Guide 3; ii) net local country claims are reduced by local country liabilities (regardless of currency denomination) excluding any debt that is funding the local assets through a foreign domiciled subsidiary for FFIEC compared to Guide 3 where only amounts in the same currencies are offset and such debt noted above is a reduction to local country claims; iii) the FFIEC methodology includes mark-to-market exposures of derivative assets which are excluded under Guide 3; and iv) investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries are included under FFIEC but excluded under Guide 3.
824. The following table presents the aggregate amount of cross-border outstandings from borrowers or counterparties for each foreign country that exceeds 1 percent of consolidated total assets for any of the periods reported below. Cross-border outstandings include loans, receivables, interest-bearing deposits with other banks, other interest-bearing investments and monetary assets that are denominated in either dollars or other non-local currency.
825. The table separately presents the amounts of cross-border outstandings by type of borrower including governments and official institutions, banks and other financial institutions and other, along with an analysis of local country assets net of local country liabilities.
826. Years EndedDecember 31,(Millions)
827. United Kingdom
828. Netherlands
829. Other countries (a)
830. Includes the following countries each of whose cross-border outstandings are between 0.75 percent and 1.0 percent of consolidated total assets: (i) Mexico; (ii) Italy; and (iii) Sweden.
831. Generally, all charge and credit cards have revocable lines of credit, and therefore, are not disclosed as cross border commitments. Refer to loan concentrations on page 56 for amount of unused lines of credit.
832. The following table summarizes the changes to the Companys allowance for cardmember loan losses. The table segregates such changes between U.S. and non-U.S. borrowers.
833. Refer to Note 5 on page 82 in the Annual Report for a discussion of managements process for evaluating allowance for loan losses.
834. In the third quarter of 2008, the Company revised its method of reporting the cardmember lending net write-off rate. Historically, the net write-off rate has been presented using net write-off amounts for principal, interest, and fees. However, industry convention is generally to include only the net write-offs related to principal in write-off rate disclosures. The write-off rate for 2009, 2008 and 2007 is a principal only write-off rate consistent with industry convention. The write-off rate for 2006 and 2005 reflects principal only write-offs in the U.S. and total write-offs (principal, interest, and fees) outside the U.S. as principal only write-off information was not available outside the U.S. for 2006 and prior periods.
835. For purposes of calculating the net write-off rate in accordance with (b) above, net write-offs were $2.9 billion, $2.6 billion, $1.6 billion, $1.2 billion and $985 million for 2009-2005, respectively.
836. The amount for 2009 primarily includes $160 million of reserves that were removed in connection with securitizations during the year. The offset is in the allocated cost of the associated retained subordinated securities. For 2008, this amount includes reclassification of waived fee reserves to contra-cardmember loans. This amount, for all periods, also includes foreign currency translation adjustments.
837. Average cardmember loans are based on monthly balances.
838. The following table summarizes the changes to the Companys allowance for other loan losses. The table segregates such changes between U.S. and non-U.S. borrowers. (a) (b)
839. Not all information for 2005 has been presented as the information was not available.
840. Provisions for other loan losses are determined based on a specific identification methodology and models that analyze specific portfolios statistics.
841. Includes primarily foreign currency translation adjustments.
842. Calculated as net write-offs as a percentage of average other loans, which are based on monthly balances.
843. The following table summarizes the changes to the Companys allowance for losses on cardmember receivables. The table segregates such changes between U.S. and non-U.S. borrowers.
844. Refer to Note 4 on page 80 in the Annual Report for a discussion of managements process for evaluating allowance for loan losses.
845. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company revised the time period in which past due cardmember receivables in U.S. Card Services are written off to 180 days past due, consistent with applicable regulatory guidance. Previously, receivables were written off when 360 days past billing. The net write-offs for 2008 include approximately $341 million resulting from this write-off methodology change.
846. Includes foreign currency translation adjustments for all periods. For 2008, this amount also included other adjustments primarily related to the reclassification of waived fee reserves to a contra-cardmember receivable.
847. The net write-off rate presented is on a worldwide basis and is based on write-offs of principal and fees. The U.S. Card Services write-off rate was 3.8 percent for 2009 and 3.6 percent for 2008 and is based on principal-only write-offs. Averages are based on monthly balances. If the $341 million referenced in (b) above had been included in U.S. Card Services write-offs, the net write-off rate would have been 5.4 percent for 2008.
848. The net loss ratio represents the worldwide ratio of charge card write-offs consisting of principal (resulting from authorized and unauthorized transactions) and fee components, less recoveries, on cardmember receivables expressed as a percent of gross amounts billed to customers. As a result of the change discussed in (b) above, the Company stopped calculating the worldwide net loss ratio beginning in 2008. The net loss ratio for 2009 and 2008 for International Card Services was 0.36 percent and 0.24 percent, respectively and for Global Commercial Services was 0.19 percent and 0.13 percent, respectively.
849. The following table presents an allocation of the allowance for losses for loans and cardmember receivables and the percent of loans and cardmember receivables in each category of total loans and cardmember receivables, respectively, by customer type. The table segregates loans and cardmember receivables and related allowances for losses between U.S. and non-U.S. borrowers.
850. The following table presents the average balances and average interest rate paid for types of customer deposits segregated between U.S. and non-U.S. offices. Refer to Note 9, Customer Deposits on page 93 in the Annual Report for additional information.
851. Other (b) (c)
852. Averages are based on monthly balances.
853. The average balances include primarily non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing demand deposits.
854. Includes primarily non-interest-bearing demand, interest-bearing demand and savings deposits. None of these customer deposit categories exceeded 10 percent of average total customer deposits for any of the periods presented.
855. The following table presents the amount of time certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more issued by the Company in its U.S. offices, further segregated by time remaining until maturity.
856. U.S. time certificates of deposits ($100,000 or more)
857. As of December 31, 2009, the Company did not have time deposits of $100,000 or more issued by non-U.S. offices.
858. The following table presents the Companys return on average total assets, return on average shareholders equity, dividend payout ratio, and average shareholders equity to average total assets ratio.

866. Effective January 1, 2009, guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities requires that restricted stock awards be included in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Accordingly, the Company has retrospectively adjusted EPS for 2008 and 2007.

877. Includes term federal funds purchased and overnight federal funds purchased.
878. Short-term borrowings, including commercial paper and federal funds purchased, are defined as any debt instrument with an original maturity of 12 months or less. Federal funds purchased represent overnight and term funds as well as Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Commercial paper generally is issued in amounts not less than $100,000 and with maturities of 270 days or less. Other short-term borrowings include interest-bearing overdrafts with banks, interest bearing amounts due to merchants in accordance with merchant service agreements, as well as other short-term borrowings.
879. This section highlights specific risks that could affect our Company and its businesses. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our Company. However, the risks and uncertainties our Company faces are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.
880. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events or if the circumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur or continue to occur, these events or circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. These events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.
881. Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world.
882. Ongoing concerns over the availability and cost of credit, the mortgage and real estate markets, sovereign debt crises, fear of a double-dip recession and geopolitical issues have contributed to uncertain expectations for the economy and the markets going forward. These factors, combined with still relatively low levels of business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, continue to impact global economies, which helped drive declines in credit and charge card usage and adverse changes in payment patterns by consumers and businesses. It is unclear the degree to which the U.S. governments economic stimulus spending will foster economic growth in the United States during the remainder of 2010. This environment has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on us, in part because we are very dependent upon consumer and business behavior. If the economy were to worsen, customer behaviors could change further. For example, Cardmembers could decide to redeem Membership Rewards points at abnormally high levels to replace cash expenditures.
883. Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, interest rates, the volatility and strength of the capital markets and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, our profitability. An economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending is likely to materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, the factors discussed above may cause our earnings, credit metrics and margins to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of analysts and investors, who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our business, and may impact the trading price of our common shares.
884. The scarcity of available credit, lack of confidence in the financial markets, reduced consumer and business spending, and credit metric performance also pose other risks to our results of operations and financial condition. In particular, we may face the following risks, among others, in connection with these events:
885. The processes we use to estimate losses may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, that may no longer be capable of accurate estimation.
886. Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite credit to our customers become less predictive of future write-offs.
887. In the event the respective three-month average rate of excess spread earned on credit card loans and charge card receivables securitized by us falls below certain designated levels, the securitization trusts established by us would be required to fund a cash reserve account (from cash that would normally revert back to us through the collection process), or, in the event such three-month average should fall below zero, the securitization trusts established by us would be required to amortize earlier than scheduled, which would accelerate our need for additional funding.
888. Political or economic instability in certain regions or countries could also affect our commercial or other lending activities, among other businesses, or result in restrictions on convertibility of certain currencies. In addition, our travel network may be adversely affected by world geopolitical and other conditions. Travel expenditures are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns.
889. Terrorist attacks, natural disasters or other catastrophic events may have a negative effect on our business. Because of our proximity to the World Trade Center, our headquarters were damaged as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Similar events or other disasters or catastrophic events in the future could have a negative effect on our businesses and infrastructure, including our information technology systems. Because we derive a portion of our revenues from travel-related spending, our business will be sensitive to safety concerns, and thus is likely to decline during periods in which travelers become concerned about safety issues or when travel might involve health-related risks.
890. If the conditions described above (or similar ones) persist or worsen, we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.
891. The global money and capital markets, while demonstrating generally improved conditions, remain susceptible to volatility and disruption, which could negatively impact market liquidity conditions.
892. We need liquidity to pay operating expenses, interest on debt and dividends on capital stock and to repay maturing liabilities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to limit our investments in growth opportunities or curtail operations. The principal sources of our liquidity are payments from Cardmembers, cash flow from our investment portfolio and assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash, deposits placed with the Companys U.S. banks, debt instruments such as unsecured medium- and long-term notes and asset securitizations, and long-term committed bank borrowing facilities in certain non-U.S. markets.
893. Notwithstanding our solid financial position, we are not immune from pressures experienced broadly across the financial markets. The fragility of the credit markets and the current economic and regulatory environment have impacted financial services companies. Although the market for our unsecured term debt and asset securitizations has improved since the third quarter of 2009, there is no assurance that the markets will be open to us in the future. Therefore, our ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent on investor demand. In addition, our liquidity position will be impacted by our ability to meet our objectives with respect to the growth of our brokered retail CD program and brokerage sweep account program and the implementation of our direct deposit initiative. We also would have less flexibility in accessing the commercial paper market as a short-term funding vehicle due to Credcos short-term debt rating and the volatility in the commercial paper market generally.
894. In the event that current sources of liquidity, including internal sources, do not satisfy our needs, we would be required to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit and consumer deposits, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings (which were downgraded in April 2009 by two of the major ratings agencies), and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that lenders or depositors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large credit losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to an economic downturn.
895. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. While we experienced some positive credit trends in the latter half of 2009, if the performance of our charge card and credit card portfolios were to weaken through increasing delinquencies and write-offs, our long-term and short-term debt ratings could be further downgraded and our access to capital could be materially adversely affected and our cost of capital could increase. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business. Such market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the capital necessary to grow our business. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital or bear an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility. If levels of market disruption and volatility worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
896. For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see Financial ReviewFunding Programs and Activities on pages 40-43 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
897. Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial services institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies. Defaults or non-performance by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by one or more of our counterparties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
898. Although the Companys and its subsidiaries long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by the major rating agencies, the ratings of that debt have been downgraded during the second quarter of 2009 by Moodys Investors Services (Moodys) and Standard & Poors (S&P), two of the major rating agencies. The rating agencies regularly evaluate the Company and its subsidiaries, and their ratings of the Companys and its subsidiaries long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors, including their financial strength as well as factors not entirely within their control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally, and the wider state of the economy. There can be no assurance that the Company and its subsidiaries will maintain their current respective ratings. Failure to maintain those ratings could, among other things, adversely limit our access to the capital markets and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the Company and its subsidiaries are able to obtain funding.
899. We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take. As with other companies in the financial services industry, the Companys and its subsidiaries ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies.
900. During 2009, over 32% of our revenue net of interest expense was generated from activities outside the United States. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and some of the revenue we generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable and indeterminate fluctuations if the
901. values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar. Resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income. Furthermore, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies into U.S. dollars. The occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could decrease the revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
902. The CARD Act requires the Company to make fundamental changes to many of our current business practices, including marketing, underwriting, pricing and billing. Among other things, the CARD Act prohibits an issuer from increasing the APR on outstanding balances (with limited exceptions), requires additional account disclosures, provides consumers with the right to opt out of significant changes to account terms, and restricts penalty fees and charges that may be imposed by an issuer.
903. Most of the requirements of the CARD Act become effective in February 2010. Additional amendments to Regulation Z revising the open-end credit disclosure requirements become effective on July 1, 2010. Two provisions of the CARD Act do not come into effect until August 22, 2010. One of these provisions addresses the reasonableness and proportionality of penalty fees charged. The other provision requires issuers to evaluate past interest rate increases twice per year. The Federal Reserve is required to adopt regulations implementing these provisions, but has not yet done so. Because implementing regulations are not final, it is difficult to assess the impact of these two provisions. However, the regulations implementing these provisions could have a significant impact on our results of our operations.
904. While the Company is making certain changes to its product terms and practices that are designed to mitigate the impact of the changes required by the CARD Act, there is no assurance that it will be successful. The long-term impact of the CARD Act on the Companys business practices and revenues will depend upon a number of factors, including its ability to successfully implement its business strategies, consumer behavior and the actions of the Companys competitors, which are difficult to predict at this time. If the Company is not able to lessen the impact of the changes required by the CARD Act, it will have a material adverse effect on results of operations.
905. The extreme disruptions in the capital markets since mid-2007 and the resulting instability and failure of numerous financial institutions have led to numerous proposals for legislative and regulatory reform that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry and that may significantly impact the Company. These proposals include the following:
906. Establishing a federal consumer financial protection agency that would have, among other things, broad authority to regulate, and take enforcement actions against, providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services.
907. Requiring heightened scrutiny and stricter regulation of any financial institution whose combination of size, leverage and interconnectedness could pose a threat to financial stability if it failed, restricting the activities of such institutions, and allowing regulators to dismantle large or systemically important banks and financial institutions, even healthy ones, if they are considered a grave risk to the economy.
908. Requiring large financial institutions, including, as proposed, American Express, to contribute to a fund that would be used to recover the cost of dismantling a bank or financial institution that is dismantled because it poses a grave risk to the economy.
909. Changing requirements for the securitization market, including requiring sponsors of securitizations to retain a material economic interest in the credit risk associated with the underlying securitization, as well as enhanced disclosure requirements for asset securitizations.
910. Tightening controls on the ability of banking institutions to engage in transactions with affiliates.
911. Assessing financial institutions with over $50 billion in consolidated assets, including, as proposed, American Express, with a financial crisis responsibility fee assessed at approximately 0.15% of total assets (less Tier 1 capital and less FDIC-assessed deposits). The fee as proposed would last for at least the next ten years and has been proposed for the purpose of recovering projected losses from the Troubled Asset Relief Program.
912. Limiting the size and activities of financial institutions, including proposals to repeal portions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.
913. Amending regulatory capital standards, and increasing regulatory capital requirements, for banks and other financial institutions, including American Express and its insured depository institution subsidiaries, and establishing new formulaic liquidity requirements applicable to financial institutions, including those proposals described above under Supervision and RegulationProposed Capital and Liquidity Requirements on pages 38-39.
914. Establishing heightened standards for and increased scrutiny of compensation policies at financial institutions, including those proposals described above under Supervision and RegulationsCompensation Practices on pages 44-45.
915. Lawmakers and regulators in the United States and worldwide continue to consider these and a number of other wide-ranging and comprehensive proposals for altering the structure, regulation and competitive relationships of the nations financial institutions. For example, separate comprehensive financial reform bills were introduced in both houses of Congress in the second half of 2009, and the U.S. House of Representatives passed a financial reform bill in December of 2009, but similar action has not been taken by the U.S. Senate.
916. In addition to proposed legislation effecting the financial services industry, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by other legislative action or inaction, including the potential failure of the U.S. Congress to extend the active financing exception to Subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code, which could increase our effective tax rate and have an adverse impact on our net income.
917. We cannot predict the final form, or effects on American Express, of these or other potential or proposed reforms. These and other potential or proposed legislative and regulatory changes could impact the profitability of the Companys business activities, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities, require the Company to change certain of its business practices or alter its relationships with customers, affect retention of key Company personnel, or expose the Company to additional costs (including increased compliance costs). Such changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
918. Please see Supervision and Regulation on pages35-45 for more information about the regulation to which we are subject.
919. The credit rating agencies are assessing the potential impact of the adoption of recently issued accounting standards for transfers of financial assets and for consolidation of variable interest entities (the New Accounting Standards) on credit ratings of the securities issued by securitization trusts within the overall asset-backed
920. securities market. (The New Accounting Standards, previously issued as FASB Statements Nos. 166 and 167, are discussed further in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which you can find on page 76 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders and which is incorporated herein by reference.) In particular, the agencies are assessing the FDICs safe harbor rule relating to the FDICs treatment of securitized assets in the event of a sponsoring financial institutions receivership or conservatorship. Pursuant to the safe harbor rule, the FDIC will not reclaim any financial asset transferred in connection with a securitization, provided that such transfer meets all conditions for GAAP sale accounting. Although the FDIC extended, on an interim basis, the safe harbor rule to some transfers of financial assets in connection with securitizations where the transfer will no longer qualify for sale accounting treatment under GAAP as a result of the New Accounting Standards, the Company cannot predict how the FDIC will act and whether or to what extent the safe harbor rule might apply in the future. Because the adoption of the New Accounting Standards may cause some asset transfers to securitization trusts to no longer be deemed asset sales for accounting purposes within a companys consolidated group, the rating agencies have indicated that they may ultimately conclude that the safe harbor no longer applies and, in certain cases, that the highest rating an ABS security could receive would be based on the sponsoring banks unsecured debt rating, rather than relying on their separate evaluation of the securitization trust. Accordingly, the ability of the Companys securitization programs to receive or maintain AAA ratings on ABS securities under the same terms and conditions as it has done in the past, or at all, is subject to uncertainty. Any action by the rating agencies as described above could adversely impact the Companys ability to utilize ABS as a source of funding for its business.
921. FDIC deposit insurance assessments have become considerably higher recently because market developments have significantly depleted the FDIC deposit insurance fund and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. The failure of additional insured depository institutions could result in further depletion of the deposit insurance fund. Assessments may continue to increase, and special assessments may be levied, until the value of the fund has returned to levels the FDIC determines appropriate. We generally cannot control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. We cannot predict whether, or to what extent, the FDIC will increase deposit insurance assessments further or whether the FDIC will levy additional special assessments. Further increase in assessments, or imposition of special assessments, by the FDIC could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
922. On November 14, 2008, American Express Company and TRS each became bank holding companies under the BHC Act and have elected to be treated as financial holding companies under the BHC Act. As a result of becoming a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve, including, without limitation, consolidated capital regulation at the holding company level, maintenance of certain capital and management standards in connection with our two U.S. depository institutions and restrictions on our non-banking activities under the Federal Reserves regulations. For additional information about this change in regulatory status, please see Supervision and RegulationGeneral beginning on page 35 above.
923. If we fail to satisfy regulatory requirements applicable to bank holding companies, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
924. We are limited in our ability to pay dividends by our regulators who could prohibit a dividend that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice. For example, it is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings, and only if
925. prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations expected future needs, asset quality, and financial condition. For more information on bank holding company dividend restrictions, please see Financial ReviewShare Repurchases and Dividends on page 40 and Note 23 on page 119 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
926. We are subject to regulations that affect banks and the payments industry in the United States and many other countries in which our charge and credit Cards are used and where we conduct banking and Card activities. In particular, we are subject to numerous regulations applicable to financial institutions in the United States and abroad. We are also subject to regulations as a provider of services to financial institutions. Regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years. For example, we are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to maintaining effective anti-money laundering programs. Increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services we may offer to consumers, the countries in which our charge and credit Cards may be used, and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or accept our charge and credit Cards. In addition, the European Union has adopted a new legislative directive, called the Payment Services Directive, for electronic payment services, including cards, that puts in place a common legal framework for licensing and supervision of payment services providers, including card issuers and merchant acquirers, and for their conduct of business.
927. The U.S. Congress is also presently considering, or may consider, legislative initiatives in the area of Internet transactions, such as Internet prescription drug purchases and copyright and trademark infringement, among others, that could impose additional compliance burdens on our Company. Federal and state law enforcement authorities have also contacted payment companies concerning these issues. If implemented, these initiatives may require us to monitor, filter, restrict, or otherwise oversee various categories of charge and credit card transactions, thereby increasing our costs or decreasing our transaction volumes. Various regulatory agencies and legislatures are also considering regulations and legislation covering identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, security, and marketing that would impact us directly, in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting standards. These new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner with other financial institutions, which could decrease our transaction volumes. In some circumstances, new regulations and legislation could have the effect of limiting our ability to offer new types of charge or credit cards or restricting our ability to offer existing Cards, such as stored value cards, which could materially and adversely reduce our revenues and revenue growth.
928. In recent years, regulators in several countries outside the United States have focused on the fees involved in the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers and the fees merchants are charged to accept cards. Regulators in the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Poland, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, the European Union (EU), Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela, among others, have conducted investigations that are either ongoing or on appeal. The interchange fee, which is the collectively set fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank in four party payment networks, like Visa and MasterCard, is generally the largest component of the merchant service charge charged to merchants for bankcard debit and credit card acceptance in these systems. By contrast, the American Express network does not have collectively set interchange fees. Although the regulators focus has primarily been on Visa and MasterCard as the dominant card networks and on their operations on a multilateral basis, antitrust actions and government regulation of the bankcard associations pricing could ultimately affect all networks. Lower interchange and/or merchant discount revenue may lead card issuers to look for other sources of revenue such as higher annual card fees or interest charges, as well as to reduce costs by scaling back or eliminating rewards programs.
929. In the United States, Congress continues to debate the interchange issue. There have been several hearings on Visa/MasterCard interchange over the last several years, and in 2009 at the request of Congress, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) completed a study on the structure of interchange fees and their impact on consumers and merchants. The report provides a balanced view of the interchange issue and explains how large merchants would benefit and how consumers could be harmed by the pending legislative proposals. In 2009, legislation was reintroduced in Congress that would give all U.S. merchants antitrust immunity to negotiate collectively the price and terms of card acceptance on networks. The House Judiciary Committee bill covers networks with at least a 20% share of U.S. credit and debit card payments combined, which would not apply to the American Express network but, if enacted, would have an effect on American Express in the marketplace. The Senate version of the bill covers networks with at least 10% of U.S. credit or debit payments, which would apply to American Express. Both bills have a default process for having prices and terms set through government action rather than competitive forces. A similar version of the House bill (the Credit Card Fair Fee Act) was passed in the House Judiciary Committee in 2008. No action was taken on either of these bills in 2009. The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on a third piece of interchange-related legislation that was reintroduced in 2009 (the Credit Card Interchange Fees Act), a bill that would regulate payment network rules, including the American Express network. No further action was taken on this bill. It is expected that Congressional hearings will continue in 2010 on the interchange issue. The Federal Reserve and various Federal Reserve Banks have been following developments on interchange and have held several conferences focused on interchange rates. While the Federal Reserve has expressed interest in monitoring this issue, it has not indicated the need to regulate interchange rates in the United States.
930. Increased regulatory focus on our Company, such as in connection with the matters discussed above, may increase our compliance costs or result in a reduction of transactions processed on our networks or merchant discount revenues from such transactions, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.
931. Our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to compete in our industry, we need to continue to invest in business process and technology advances across all areas of our business, including in transaction processing, data management, customer interactions and communications, travel reservations systems, prepaid products, alternative payment mechanisms and risk management and compliance systems. We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our Cards, networks and other services. Our ability to develop, acquire, or access competitive technologies or business processes on acceptable terms may be limited by patent rights that third parties, including competitors and potential competitors, may assert. In addition, our ability to adopt new technologies that we develop may be inhibited by a need for industry-wide standards or by resistance from Cardmembers or merchants to such changes.
932. We rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, including copyrights, trademarks, patents and controls on access and distribution. These measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage. In addition, competitors or other third parties may allege that our systems, processes or technologies infringe their intellectual property rights. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property related litigation, we cannot assure you that a future assertion of an infringement claim against us will not cause us to lose significant revenues, incur significant license, royalty or technology development expenses, or pay significant monetary damages.
933. We are subject to regulations related to privacy and data security/breach, and we could be negatively impacted by these regulations. For example, in the United States, we are subject to the data security rule under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The data security rule requires that each financial institution develop, implement, and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institutions size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institutions activities, and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue.
934. Further, a growing number of states, including, notably, Massachusetts and Nevada, have adopted broad-ranging data security regulations regarding the protection of customer and employee data that could result in higher compliance and technology costs for the Company, as well as potentially significant fines and penalties for non-compliance.
935. Many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate are also expanding the scope of their data security requirements and standards, as well as increasing enforcement activity in this area. In 1995, the European Parliament and Council passed European Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (commonly referred to as the Data Protection Directive), which obligates the controller of an individuals personal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. The Data Protection Directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protection in European Union Member States. As these laws expand throughout the European Union where we have a significant commercial presence, compliance costs are increasing, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data privacy protections and data transfer mechanisms are in place.
936. In addition to the foregoing enhanced data security requirements, various federal banking regulatory agencies, and as many as 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, have enacted data breach regulations and laws requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of a security breach. Data breach laws are also becoming more prevalent in other parts of the world where we operate, including Japan, Mexico and Germany. In many countries that have yet to impose automatic data breach notification requirements, regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage data breaches. Many of these regulations also apply broadly to retailers/merchants that accept our cards; thus, to the extent they experience data security breaches, this presents additional risks for American Express and our Cardmembers. The heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data privacy and security, including requiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach, continues. The current 111th Congress will likely consider data security/data breach legislation in 2010 that, if implemented, could present new risks and costs for us.
937. We continue to seek ways to minimize these risks and costs internally by improving our own data privacy and security policies and practices, and externally through regular improvements to the PCI Data Security Standard and by placing strong contractual obligations on retailers/merchants that accept our Cards, as well as on our service providers, relating to data security and data breach. Still, increased regulation and enforcement activity throughout the world in the areas of data privacy and data security/breach may materially increase our costs and may decrease the number of our Cards that we issue, or restrict our ability to fully exploit our closed-loop capability, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with the privacy and data security/breach laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions, and damage to our global reputation and our brand.
938. Our success depends, in part, on our executive officers and other key personnel. Our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Our senior management team is
939. relatively small and we believe we are in a critical period of competition in the financial services and payments industry. The market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel. As further described in Supervision and RegulationCompensation Practices on pages 44-45, our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve. As a large financial and banking institution, we may be subject to limitations on compensation practices, which may or may not affect our competitors, by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC or other regulators worldwide. These limitations, including any incentive compensation policies, could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business.
940. Businesses in the credit card industry have historically been subject to significant legal actions, including class action lawsuits and patent claims. Many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages. In addition, we may be involved in various actions or proceedings brought by governmental regulatory agencies in the event of noncompliance with laws or regulations, which could subject us to significant fines, penalties or other requirements resulting in increased expenses and damage to our global reputation and our brand.
941. The payments industry is highly competitive and includes, in addition to charge and credit card networks, evolving alternative payment mechanisms and systems. We are the third largest general-purpose charge and credit card network based on charge volume, behind Visa and MasterCard, which are larger than we are in most markets. As a result, other card issuers may be able to benefit from the strong position and marketing and pricing power of Visa and MasterCard. Because of continuing consolidations among banking and financial services companies and credit card portfolio acquisitions by major card issuers, there are now a smaller number of significant issuers. Continuing consolidation in the banking industry may result in a financial institution with a strong relationship with us being acquired by an institution that has a strong relationship with a competitor, resulting in a potential loss of business for us. The largest competing issuers have continued to grow, in several cases by acquiring card portfolios, and also by cross-selling through their retail branch networks, and competition among all issuers remains intense. We are also subject to increasing pricing pressure from our competitors.
942. In addition, some of our competitors have developed, or may develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have. We may not continue to be able to compete effectively against these threats.
943. Our competitors may also be more efficient in introducing innovative products, programs and services than we are. Spending on our Cards could be impacted by consumer usage of debit cards, as we do not currently issue point-of-sale debit cards for use on the American Express Network. In fact, the purchase volume and number of transactions made with debit cards in the United States has grown more rapidly than credit and charge card transactions. In addition, to the extent alternative payment mechanisms and systems, such as aggregators, continue to successfully expand in the online payments space, our merchant revenues and our ability to access transaction data through our closed-loop network could be negatively impacted.
944. Regulators have recently put forward various proposals that may impact our businesses, including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage and the size of financial institutions, and proposals to impose taxes or fees on certain financial institutions. These or similar proposals, which may not apply to all of our competitors, could impact our ability to compete effectively.
945. Unlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on high revolving credit balances to drive profits, our business model is focused on Cardmember spending. Discount revenue, which represents fees charged to merchants when Cardmembers use their Cards to purchase goods and services on our network, is primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest single revenue source. In recent years, we have been under market pressure to reduce merchant discount rates and undertake other repricing initiatives. This pressure arises, in part, due to the regulatory pressure on our competitors outside the United States, which has been increasing. If we continue to experience a decline in the average merchant discount rate we charge merchants or are unable to sustain premium merchant discount rates on our Cards without experiencing overall volume growth or an increase in merchant coverage, our revenues and profitability could be materially and adversely affected.
946. Our business is characterized by the high level of spending by our Cardmembers. Increasing consumer and business spending and borrowing on our payment services products, particularly credit and charge Cards and Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products, and growth in Card lending balances, depend in part on our ability to develop and issue new or enhanced Card and prepaid products and increase revenues from such products. One of the ways in which we attract new Cardmembers, reduce Cardmember attrition and seek to capture a greater share of customers total spending on Cards issued on our network, both in the United States and in our international operations, is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Cardmember benefits. We may not be able to cost effectively manage and expand Cardmember benefits, including containing the growth of marketing, promotion and rewards expenses and Cardmember services expenses. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and co-brand programs that are similar to ours, and issuers may in the future institute programs that are more attractive to cardmembers than our programs.
947. Our ability to continue to invest in marketing, promotion and rewards programs, as well as our overall profitability, may be negatively impacted if we are unable to replace the payments provided to us under our previously disclosed litigation settlements with Visa and MasterCard once the aggregate settlement amounts have been paid in full through the fourth and second quarters of 2011, respectively.
948. Our brand and its attributes are key assets of the Company. Our ability to attract and retain consumer Cardmembers and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service, trustworthiness, business practices and financial condition. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing and potential Cardmembers and corporate clients, which could make it difficult for us to attract new Cardmembers and maintain existing ones. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us. Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negative perceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
949. We and other third parties store Cardmember account information in connection with our charge and credit Cards. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture various types of information relating to Cardmembers accounts, including Membership Rewards accounts, to engage in illegal activities such as fraud and identity theft. As outsourcing and specialization become a more acceptable and common way of doing business in the payments industry, there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our Cards. If data breaches or fraud levels involving our Cards were to rise, it could lead to regulatory intervention
950. (such as mandatory card reissuance) and reputational and financial damage to our brand, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our Cards, and have a material adverse impact on our business.
951. In the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we have partnered with Costco and Delta Air Lines to offer co-branded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our Membership Rewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, most notably the airline industry, to offer benefits to Cardmember participants. The airline industry represents a significant portion of our billed business and in recent years has undergone bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events. In addition, under some types of these contractual arrangements, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain co-brand partners, merchants, vendors and customers. If we are not able to effectively manage the triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, we have credit risk to certain co-brand partners relating to our prepayments for loyalty program points that will not be fully redeemed for multi-year periods. We are also exposed to risk from bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events that may occur in any industry representing a significant portion of our billed business, which could negatively impact particular card products and services (and billed business generally) and our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we could be materially impacted if we were obligated to or elected to reimburse Cardmembers for products and services purchased from merchants that are bankrupt or have ceased operations.
952. There could be continued significant consolidation in the airline industry, particularly in the United States, through mergers and/or grants of antitrust immunity to airline alliances and joint ventures. The United States Department of Transportation has granted antitrust immunity to members of the Skyteam Alliance and the Star Alliance, enabling them to closely coordinate their international operations and to launch highly integrated joint ventures in transatlantic and other markets. The Department of Transportation has granted preliminary approval of a similar request by members of the Oneworld Alliance for antitrust immunity. Among other things, this immunity permits alliance members to jointly price and manage capacity on covered routes, share revenues and costs, and coordinate sales and corporate contracts, outside of the scope of the antitrust laws. The European Commissions review of each of these alliances is continuing. Increasing consolidation and expanded antitrust immunity could create challenges for our relationships with the airlines including by reducing our profitability on our airline business. Airlines are also some of the most important and valuable partners in our Membership Rewards program. If a participating airline merged with an airline that did not participate in Membership Rewards, the combined airline would have to determine whether or not to continue participation. Similarly, if one of our co-brand airline partners merged with an airline that had a competing co-brand card, the combined airline would have to determine which co-brand cards it would offer. If a surviving airline determined to withdraw from Membership Rewards or to cease offering an American Express co-brand card, our business could be adversely affected. For additional information relating to the agreements with Delta and general risks related to the airline industry, see Financial ReviewExposure to Airline Industry on page 60 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
953. We have regularly undertaken, and are currently undertaking, a variety of efforts to reengineer our business operations in order to achieve cost savings and other benefits (including the reinvestment of such savings in key areas such as marketing, promotion, rewards and infrastructure), enhance revenue-generating opportunities and
954. improve our operating expense to revenue ratio both in the short-term and over time. These efforts include cost management, structural and strategic measures such as vendor, process, facilities and operations consolidation, outsourcing functions (including, among others, technologies operations), relocating certain functions to lower cost overseas locations, moving internal and external functions to the Internet to save costs and planned staff reductions relating to certain of these reengineering actions. If we do not successfully achieve these efforts in a timely manner or if we are not able to capitalize on these efforts, including the ability of the Global Services Group to generate an annualized level of gross expense savings of approximately $500 million by 2012, we may not realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we intended. Failure to achieve these benefits could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
955. We must effectively manage credit risk related to consumer debt, business loans, settlement risk with regard to GNS partners, merchant bankruptcies, the rate of bankruptcies, and other credit trends that can affect spending on Card products, debt payments by individual and corporate customers and businesses that accept our Card products.
956. Credit risk is the risk of loss from obligor or counterparty default. We are exposed to both consumer credit risk, principally from Cardmember receivables and our other consumer lending activities, and institutional credit risk from merchants, GNS partners and GCC clients. Third parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Country, regional and political risks are components of credit risk. Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs and may require us to increase our reserve for loan losses. Higher write-off rates and an increase in our reserve for loan losses adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations, and may increase our cost of funds.
957. Although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loans and receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. In addition, the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete. Although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. We may also fail to receive full information with respect to the credit risks of our customers.
958. We must also effectively manage market risk to which we are exposed. Market risk represents the loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in market variables. We are exposed to market risk from interest rates in our Card business and in our investment portfolios. Changes in the interest rates at which we borrow and lend money affect the value of our assets and liabilities. If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and consequently our net income, could fall.
959. We must also accurately estimate the fair value of the assets in our investment portfolio and, in particular, those investments that are not readily marketable.
960. Additionally, we must effectively manage liquidity risk to which we are exposed. Liquidity risk is defined as the inability to access cash and equivalents needed to meet business requirements and satisfy our obligations. If we are unsuccessful in managing our liquidity risk, we may maintain too much liquidity, which can be costly and limit financial flexibility, or we may be too illiquid, which could result in financial distress during a liquidity event. For additional information regarding our management of liquidity risk, see Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital above.
961. Finally, we must also manage the operational risks to which we are exposed. We consider operational risk to be the risk of not achieving our business objectives due to failed processes, people or information systems, or from the external environment, such as natural disasters. Operational risks include the risk that we may not
962. comply with specific regulatory or legal requirements, exposing us to fines and/or penalties and possibly brand damage; employee error or intentional misconduct that results in a material financial misstatement; or a failure to monitor an outsource partners compliance with a service level agreement, resulting in economic harm to us.
963. As an additional source of funding, our banking subsidiaries offer deposits to individuals through brokerage networks as well as directly to consumers.
964. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $26.3 billion in total customer deposits, a large portion of which was raised through brokerage networks. Many other financial services firms are increasing their use of deposit funding, and as such we may experience increased competition in the deposit markets, particularly as to brokerage networks. We cannot predict how this increased competition will affect deposit renewal rates, costs or availability. If we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted.
965. Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on capital levels of our bank subsidiaries. The FDIA generally prohibits a bank, including our banking subsidiaries, from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless (1) it is well-capitalized or (2) it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is adequately capitalized generally may not pay an interest rate on any deposit, including direct-to-consumer deposits, in excess of 75 basis points over the national rate published by the FDIC. There are no such restrictions on a bank that is well-capitalized (provided such bank is not subject to a capital maintenance provision within a written agreement, consent order, order to cease and desist, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its federal regulator). While we met the FDICs definition of well-capitalized as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet this definition. Additionally, our regulators can adjust the requirements to be well-capitalized at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses, including the interest rate we pay on deposits. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.
966. Our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems may experience service interruptions as a result of fire, natural disasters, power loss, disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access, fraud, terrorism or accident. A natural disaster or other problem at our facilities could interrupt our services. Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global network. If a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require, as a result of natural disaster, operational disruption, terrorism or any other reason, the failure could interrupt our services, adversely affect the perception of our brands reliability and materially reduce our revenue and profitability.
967. We operate a service network around the world. In order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies, we outsource to third-party vendors many of the computer systems and other services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses. A significant amount of this outsourcing occurs in developing countries. We are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our third-party service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities. In addition, the management of multiple third-party vendors increases our operational complexity and decreases our control. It is also possible that the cost efficiencies of certain outsourcings will decrease as the demand for these services increases around the world.
968. We have made various statements in this Report that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may also be made in our other reports filed with or furnished to the SEC, in our press releases and in other documents. In addition, from time to time, we, through our management, may make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those identified above, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, may, should, could, would, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We caution you that the risk factors described above are not exclusive. There may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements.
969. Not applicable.
970. Our principal executive offices are in a 51-story, 2.2 million square foot building located in lower Manhattan. This building, which is on land leased from the Battery Park City Authority for a term expiring in 2069, is one of four office buildings in a complex known as the World Financial Center. We have a 49% ownership interest in the building. Brookfield Financial Properties owns the remaining 51% interest in the building. We also lease space in the building from Brookfield.
971. Other owned or leased principal locations include: the American Express Service Centers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; Greensboro, North Carolina; and Salt Lake City, Utah; the American Express Data Centers in Phoenix, Arizona and in Minneapolis, Minnesota; the American Express Finance Center in Phoenix, Arizona; the headquarters for American Express Services Europe Limited in London, England; the Amex Canada Inc. headquarters in Markham, Ontario, Canada; and service centers located in Mexico City, Mexico; Sydney, Australia; Gurgaon, India and Brighton, United Kingdom.
972. During 2004 and 2005, we engaged in several sale-leaseback transactions pursuant to which we sold various owned properties to third parties and leased back the properties under long-term net leases whereby each American Express entity that leases back the property is responsible for all costs and expenses relating to the property (including maintenance, repair, utilities, operating expenses and insurance costs) in addition to annual rent. The sale-leaseback transactions have not materially impacted our financial results in any year. Gains resulting from completed sale and leaseback transactions are amortized over the initial ten-year lease periods. We continue to consider whether sale-leaseback transactions are appropriate for other properties that we currently own.
973. Generally, we lease the premises we occupy in other locations. We believe that the facilities we own or occupy suit our needs and are well maintained.
974. The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in a number of legal and arbitration proceedings, including class actions, concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of their respective business activities. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to each of these actions and intends to defend them vigorously. In the course of its business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to governmental examinations, information gathering requests, subpoenas, inquiries and investigations. The Company believes that it is not a party to, nor are any of its properties the subject of, any pending legal, arbitration, regulatory, tax or investigative proceedings that would have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, it is possible that the outcome of any such proceeding could have a material impact on results of operations in any particular reporting period as the proceedings are resolved. Certain legal proceedings involving the Company are described below.
975. Beginning in mid-July 2002, 12 putative class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In October 2002, these cases were consolidated under the captionIn re American Express Company Securities Litigation. These lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws and the common law in connection with alleged misstatements regarding certain investments in high-yield bonds and write-downs in the 2000-2001 timeframe. The purported class covers the period from July 26, 1999 to July 17, 2001. The actions seek unspecified compensatory damages as well as disgorgement, punitive damages, attorneys fees and costs, and interest. On March 31, 2004, the Court granted the Companys motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In August 2006, the Court of Appeals, without expressing any views whatsoever on the merits of the cases, vacated the District Courts judgment and remanded all claims to the District Court for further proceedings. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on January 5, 2007. The Company subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which motion was granted in September 2008. Plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.
976. On November 24, 2009, a putative class action captionedAmick v. American Express Travel Related Services Co., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to recover unpaid wages and overtime compensation at one of the Companys call centers. The Plaintiff seeks to represent all similarly situated employees in a collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and in a Rule 23 class action under the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act. On January 26, 2010, the Court granted the Companys motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.
977. In May 2008, a shareholders derivative suit was filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan naming American Express Company and certain current and former directors and senior executives as defendants. The case captioned asCity of Tallahassee Retirement System v. Akerson et al.alleges breaches of fiduciary duty arising from knowing breaches of fiduciary obligations by certain current and former officers and directors of the Company that have led to the imposition of deferred criminal charges on a bank that at the time such charges were entered was owned by American Express, as well as the Companys payment of approximately $65 million in penalties to federal and state regulators related to American Express Bank Limiteds (AEBL) and TRSs anti-money laundering programs. The complaint also states that the sale of AEBL took place after American Express had allowed the value of its banking business unit to be dramatically impaired on account of the systemic violations of law and resulting deferred criminal charges. The complaint seeks monetary damages on behalf of the Company. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and in October 2009, the Court dismissed the complaint against all defendants. The plaintiff has filed a Notice of Appeal of the dismissal.
978. In December 2008, a putative class action captionedObester v. American Express Company, et. al.was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated certain ERISA obligations by: allowing the investment of American Express Retirement Savings Plan assets in American Express common stock when American Express common stock was not a prudent investment; misrepresenting and failing to disclose material facts to Plan participants in connection with the administration of the Plan; and breaching certain fiduciary obligations. The Company is also a defendant in three other putative class actions making allegations similar to those made in the Obester matter:Tang v. American Express Company, et. al., filed on December 29, 2008 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,Miner v. American Express Company et. al., filed on February 4, 2009 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, andDiLorenzo v. American Express Company et. al., filed on February 10, 2009 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. American Express has filed a motion to dismiss these actions. In April 2009, these actions were consolidated into a Consolidated Amended complaint, captionedIn Re American Express ERISA Litigation. American Express motion to dismiss this action is pending with the Court.
979. On February 20, 2009, a putative class action captioned,Brozovich v. American Express Co., Kenneth I. Chenault and Daniel T. Henry, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit alleged violations of the federal securities laws in connection with certain alleged misstatements regarding the credit quality of the Companys credit card customers. The purported class covered the period from March 1, 2007 to November 12, 2008. The action sought unspecified damages and costs and fees. The Brozovich action was subsequently voluntarily dismissed. On March 27, 2009, a putative class action, captionedBaydale v. American Express Co., Kenneth I. Chenault and Daniel Henry, which makes similar allegations to those made in the Brozovich action, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On October 13, 2009, plaintiff in the Baydale action filed an Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint in the action. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss and that motion is pending with the Court.
980. Beginning July 2003 the Company has been named in a number of putative class actions in which the plaintiffs allege an unlawful antitrust tying arrangement between certain of the Companys charge cards and credit cards in violation of various state and federal laws. These cases have since all been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption: In re American Express Merchants Litigation. A case making similar allegations was also filed in the Southern District of New York in July 2004 captioned:The Marcus Corporation v. American Express Company et al., The Marcus case is not consolidated. The plaintiffs in these actions seek injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages. On April 30, 2004, the Company filed a motion to dismiss all the actions filed prior to the date of its motion. On March 15, 2006, that motion was granted, with the Court finding the claims of the plaintiffs to be subject to arbitration. Plaintiffs asked the Court to reconsider its dismissal. That request was denied. The plaintiffs appealed the Courts arbitration ruling and on January 30, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court. The Company has filed with the United States Supreme Court a petition of certiorari from the Second Circuits arbitration ruling. That petition is pending. The Company also filed a motion to dismiss the action filed by the Marcus Corporation, which was denied in July 2005. On October 1, 2007, Marcus filed a motion seeking certification of a class. On March 30, 2009, the Court denied the plaintiffs motion for class certification without prejudice to renew upon resolution of the pending summary judgment motion. In April 2009, the Court denied plaintiffs motion for reconsideration of the March 30th order. In September 2008, American Express moved for summary judgment seeking dismissal of Marcus complaint and the plaintiff Marcus cross-moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. A decision on the summary judgment motions is pending. One case making similar allegations was filed and remains in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County (filed December 2003). The Company continues to request the California Superior Court hearing the Hayama action referenced above to stay that action. To date the Hayama action has been stayed.
981. On February 19, 2009, an amended complaint was filed inIn Re: American Express Merchants Litigation. The amended complaint contains a single count alleging a violation of federal antitrust laws through an alleged unlawful tying of: (a) corporate, small business and/or personal charge card services; and (b) Blue, Costco and standard GNS credit card services. In addition, on February 19, 2009, a new complaint making the same allegations as made in the amended complaint filed inIn Re: American Express Merchants Litigationwas also filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. That new case is captioned:Greenporter LLC and Bar Hama LLC, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated v. American Express Company and American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.Proceedings in the Greenporter action and on the amended complaint filed in In Re: American Express Merchants Litigation have been held in abeyance pending the disposition of the motions for summary judgment in the Marcus case.
982. Beginning August 2005, the Company has been named in a number of putative class actions alleging that the Companys policy prohibiting merchants from imposing restrictions on the use of American Express Cards violates U.S. antitrust laws. These cases are now all consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under the caption: In Re: American Express Anti-Steering Rules Antitrust Litigation. The plaintiffs complaint seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages. These plaintiffs have agreed that a stay would be imposed with regard to their respective actions pending the appeal of the Courts arbitration ruling discussed above. Given the ruling of the Second Circuit (discussed above), the stay has been lifted, and American Expresss response to the complaint was filed in April 2009. On December 1, 2009, the United States Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation denied the plaintiffs motion to consolidate their cases with the individual suits discussed below pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a scheduling order on December 28, 2009.
983. In June 2008, five separate lawsuits were filed against American Express Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York alleging that the Companys anti-steering rules in its merchant acceptance agreements violate federal antitrust laws. As alleged by the plaintiffs, these rules prevent merchants from offering consumers incentives to use alternative forms of payments when consumers wish to use an American Express-branded card. The five suits were filed by each of Rite-Aid Corp., CVS Pharmacy Inc., Walgreen Co., Bi-Lo LLC., and H.E. Butt Grocery Company. The plaintiff in each action seeks damages and injunctive relief. American Express filed its answer to these complaints and also filed a motion to dismiss these complaints as time barred. The Court has not yet ruled on the motion to dismiss and entered a scheduling order on January 26, 2010.
984. In July, 2009, a putative class action, captionedThe Wild Grape v. American Express Company, et al., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint challenges American Expresss policy of retaining the discount charged to certain merchants when underlying purchases are returned to the merchant by an American Express cardmember for a refund. The complaint seeks certification of a California-only class. American Express has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.
985. In June 2009, a putative class action, captionedMesi v. American Express Centurion Bank, was filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint seeks to certify a class of American Express cardmembers with billing addresses in 16 different states whose interest rates on their outstanding balances were retroactively increased by the Company. The complaint seeks, among other things, damages in excess of $5,000,000 and unspecified injunctive relief. The complaint has been amended twice by plaintiff. On December 7, 2009, the Court ordered that the matter be stayed pending decisions on relevant legal issues in other cases not involving American Express.
986. In October 2009, a putative class action, captionedLopez, et al. v. American Express Bank, FSB and American Express Centurion Bank, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint seeks to certify a nationwide class of American Express cardmembers whose interest rates were changed from fixed to variable in or around August 2009 or otherwise increases. American Express filed a motion to compel arbitration, and plaintiff has indicated they will amend their complaint to limit the class to California residents only.
987. In January 2006, in a matter captionedHoffman, et al. v. American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc., No. 2001-02281, Superior Court of the State of California, County of Alameda, the Court certified a class action against TRS. In a case management order dated April 8, 2008, the Court defined two classes as follows: (1) all persons who obtained American Express charge cards governed by New York law with billing addresses in California who purchased American Express fee based travel related insurance plans from September 6, 1995, through February 12, 2008, and (2) all persons who obtained American Express charge cards governed by New York law with billing addresses in states other than California who purchased American Express fee based travel related insurance plans from September 6, 1995, through February 12, 2008. The Court denied the plaintiffs motion to certify a class to pursue claims on behalf of persons who held American Express credit cards governed by Utah law. Plaintiffs allege that American Express violated California and New York law by allegedly billing customers for flight and baggage insurance that they did not receive. American Express denies the allegations. American Express filed a motion for summary judgment asking that the case be dismissed as a matter of law. The summary judgment motion was partially granted in July 2008 when the Court dismissed certain claims against American Express including claims for punitive damages. Certain other claims survived summary judgment. A trial on the remaining claims began in November 2008. The Company prevailed in Phase 1 of that trial with the Court ruling that the contract between the Company and its cardmembers was not ambiguous and that the Company operated the air-flight and baggage insurance program consistent with the contract. On March 25, 2009, the Court entered a preliminary order in the Companys favor in Phase 2 of the trial, finding that: (1) the contract is not unconscionable; (2) the Company did not violate California consumer protection laws; and (3) the Company did not violate New York consumer protection laws. The Court also awarded as-yet-to-be-determined costs to the Company. Plaintiff has filed a Notice of Appeal in the case. In addition, a matter making related allegations to those raised in the Hoffman case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. That matter, captionedEnvironment Law Enforcement Systems v. American Express et al., has effectively been stayed pending the proceedings in the Hoffman action. Following the favorable March 25, 2009, ruling in Hoffman, the plaintiff in Environmental Law Enforcement Systems asked the Court to lift the stay and to allow plaintiff to obtain certain cardmember information. The Company opposed that request, and the Court denied the request. Lastly, on October 30, 2008, a case making allegations similar to those raised in the Hoffman case was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. That matter, captionedKass v. American Express Card Services, Inc., American Express Company and American Express Travel Related Services, was filed as a putative class action on behalf of American Express credit card holders. On March 11, 2009, the Kass Court entered an order granting the joint motion of the parties to stay the case, and the Court also administratively closed the case.
988. In July 2004, a purported class action captionedRoss, et al. v. American Express Company, American Express Travel Related Services and American Express Centurion Bankwas filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges that American Express conspired with Visa, MasterCard and Diners Club in the setting of foreign conversion rates and in the inclusion of arbitration clauses in certain of their cardmember agreements. The suit seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages. The class is defined as all Visa, MasterCard and Diners Club general-purpose cardholders who used cards issued by any of the MDL Defendant Banks. American Express cardholders are not part of the class. In September 2005, the Court denied the Companys motion to dismiss the action and preliminarily certified an injunction class of Visa and MasterCard cardholders to determine the validity of Visas and MasterCards cardmember arbitration clauses. American Express filed a motion for reconsideration with the District Court, which motion was denied in September 2006. The Company filed an appeal from the District Courts order denying its motion to compel arbitration. In October 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied the Companys appeal and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. On January 22, 2010, the Court (1) certified a damage class of all Visa, MasterCard and Diners Club general purpose cardholders who used cards issued by any of the alleged co-conspiring banks during the period July 22, 2000 to November 8, 2006, and who were assessed a foreign transaction fee or surcharge and who have submitted valid claims inIn Re Currency Conversion Antitrust Litigation.; and (2) the Court denied American Express motion to amend its answer to add the affirmative defense of release.
989. In June 2006, a putative class action captionedHoma v. American Express Company et al.was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The case alleges, generally, misleading and fraudulent advertising of the tiered up to 5 percent cash rebates with the Blue Cash card. The complaint initially sought certification of a nationwide class consisting of all persons who applied for and received an American Express Blue Cash card during the period from September 30, 2003 to the present and who did not get the rebate or rebates provided for in the offer. On December 1, 2006, however, plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint dropping the nationwide class claims and asserting claims only on behalf of New Jersey residents who while so residing in New Jersey, applied for and received an American Express Blue Cash card during the period from September 30, 2003 to the present. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and other unspecified relief that the Court deems appropriate. In May 2007, the Court granted the Companys motion to compel individual arbitration and dismissed the complaint. Plaintiff appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and on February 24, 2009, the Third Circuit reversed the decision and remanded the case back to the District Court for further proceedings. On October 22, 2009, a putative class action captionedPagsolingan v. American Express Company, et al. was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. That case makes allegations that are largely similar to those made in Homa, except that Pagsolingan alleges multiple theories of liability and seeks to certify a nationwide class of [a]ll persons who applied for and received an American Express Blue Cash card during the period from September 30, 2003 to the present and who did not get the rebate or rebates provided for in the offer.
990. In January 2009, the Company signed a Memorandum of Understanding to resolve claims raised in a putative class action captionedKaufman v. American Express Travel Related Services, pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Since such time, the parties have entered into a settlement agreement that was submitted to the Court for preliminary approval, and a final ruling on preliminary approval remains pending. The allegations in Kaufman relate primarily to monthly service fee charges, with the critical claim being that the Companys gift card product violates consumer protection statutes because consumers allegedly have difficulty spending small residual amounts on the gift cards prior to the imposition of monthly service fees. The proposed Settlement Class consists of All purchasers, recipients and holders of all gift cards issued by American Express from January 1, 2002 through the date of preliminary approval of the Settlement, including without limitation, gift cards sold at physical retail locations, via the internet, or through mall co-branded programs. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, in addition to certain non-monetary relief, the Company would pay $3 million into a settlement fund. Members of the settlement class would then be entitled to submit claims against the settlement fund to receive refunds of certain gift card fees, and any monies remaining in the settlement fund after payment of all claims would be paid to charity. In addition, the Company would make available to the settlement class for a period of time the opportunity to buy gift cards with no purchase fee. Finally, the Company would be responsible for paying class counsels reasonable fees and expenses and certain expenses of administering the class settlement. The Company is also a defendant in two other putative class actions making allegations similar to those made in Kaufman:Goodman v. American Express Travel Related Services, pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, andJarratt v. American Express Company, filed in California state court in San Diego. If the Kaufman settlement ultimately receives final approval, all related gift cards claims and suits would also be released.
991. In May 2006, in a matter captionedMarcotte v. Bank of Montreal et al., filed in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal (originally filed in April 2003) the Court authorized a class action against Amex Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Scotiabank, National Bank of Canada, Laurentian Bank of Canada and Citibank Canada. The action alleges that conversion commissions made on foreign currency transactions are credit charges under the Quebec Consumer Protection Act (the QCPA) and cannot be charged prior to the 21-day grace period under the QCPA. The class includes all persons holding a credit card issued by one of the defendants to whom fees were charged since April 17, 2000, for transactions made in foreign currency before expiration of the period of 21 days following the statement of account. The class claims reimbursement of all foreign currency conversions,
992. CDN$400 per class member for trouble, inconvenience and punitive damages, interest and fees and costs. The trial in theMarcotteaction commenced in September 2008 and was completed in November. The Court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs against Amex Bank of Canada on June 11, 2009, and awarded damages in the amount of CDN$7.1 million plus interest on the QCPA claims and individual claims to be made on the non-disclosure claims. In addition, the Court awarded punitive damages in the amount of CDN$21.52 per cardmember. The judgment has been appealed by all banks, including Amex Bank of Canada. The appeal is expected to be heard by the Quebec Court of Appeal in the fall of 2011.
993. In November 2006, in a matter captionedSylvan Adams v. Amex Bank of Canadafiled in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal (originally filed in November 2004), the Court authorized a class action against Amex Bank of Canada. The plaintiff alleges that prior to December 2003, Amex Bank of Canada charged a foreign currency conversion commission on transactions to purchase goods and services in currencies other than Canadian dollars and failed to disclose the commissions in monthly billing statements or solicitations directed to prospective cardmembers. The class, consisting of all Cardmembers in Quebec that purchased goods or services in a foreign currency prior to December 2003, claims reimbursement of all foreign currency conversion commissions, CDN$1,000 in punitive damages per class member, interest and fees and costs. The trial in theAdamsaction commenced, and was completed, in December 2008 after the conclusion of the trial in theMarcotteaction. The Court rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs against Amex Bank of Canada on June 11, 2009, and awarded damages in the amount of CDN$11.2 million plus interest on the non-disclosure claims. In addition, the Court awarded punitive damages in the amount of CDN$2.2 million. The judgment has been appealed by Amex Bank of Canada. The appeal is expected to be heard by the Quebec Court of Appeal in the fall of 2011.
994. In November 2006, in a matter captionedOption Consommateurs and Benoit Fortin v. Amex Bank of Canada et al.filed in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Montreal (originally filed in July 2003), the Court authorized a class action against Amex Bank of Canada, Citibank Canada, MBNA Canada, Diners Club International, Capital One and Royal Bank of Canada. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants have violated the Quebec Consumer Protection Act (QCPA) by imposing finance charges on credit card transactions prior to 21 days following the receipt of the statement containing the charge. It is alleged that the QCPA provisions which require a 21-day grace period prior to imposing finance charges applies to credit cards issued by Amex Bank of Canada in Quebec and that finance charges imposed prior to this grace period violate the Act. The class seeks reimbursement of all finance charges imposed in violation of the Act, CDN$200 in punitive damages per class member, interest and fees and costs.
995. In May 2005, Amex Bank of Canada was added as a defendant to a motion to authorize a class action captionedOption Consommateurs and Joel-Christian St-Pierre v. Bank of Montreal et al.filed in the Superior Court of Quebec, District of Quebec. The motion, which also names as defendants Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, HSBC Bank of Canada, among others, alleges that the defendants violated QCPA by imposing finance charges on credit card transactions prior to 21 days following the receipt of the statement containing the charge. It is alleged that the QCPA provisions, which require a 21-day grace period prior to imposing finance charges, applies to credit cards issued by Amex Bank of Canada in Quebec and that finance charges imposed prior to this grace period violate the QCPA. The proposed class seeks reimbursement of all finance charges imposed in violation of the QCPA, CDN$100 in punitive damages per class member, interest and fees and costs.
996. During the last few years as regulatory interest in credit card network pricing to merchants and related issues has increased, the Company has responded to many inquiries from banking and competition authorities throughout the world. On October 14, 2008, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID), dated October 10, 2008, from the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). A CID is a request for information in the course of a civil investigation and does not constitute the commencement of legal
997. proceedings. The DOJ is permitted by statute to issue a CID to anyone whom it believes may have information relevant to an investigation. The receipt of a CID does not presuppose that there is probable cause to believe that a violation of the antitrust laws has occurred or that a formal complaint ultimately will be filed. The DOJ has requested the production of documents and information regarding the Companys policies relating to merchant surcharging and its anti-steering policies that prohibit merchants from discriminating against the Card in favor of other forms of payment. The Company is cooperating with the DOJs request. The Company has also received a similar civil investigative demand from the attorney general of the state of Ohio. These investigations are ongoing.
998. We did not submit any matters to a vote of our security holders during the last quarter of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.

57. All references in this Annual Report to AS&E, the Company, we, our and us means American Science and Engineering, Inc. and its subsidiary.
58. American Science and Engineering, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation formed in 1958, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells X-ray inspection and other detection solutions for homeland security and other targeted markets. AS&E
59. provides maintenance, warranty, research, engineering, and training services related to these solutions.
60. The Company manufactures sophisticated X-ray inspection products that can be used to inspect parcels, baggage, vehicles, pallets, cargo containers, and people. The Company sells its products throughout the world to a variety of customers, including:
61. Authorities responsible for port and border security;
62. Military organizations;
63. High threat commercial and government facilities;
64. Aviation security agencies; and
65. Legal enforcement agencies
66. AS&Es products are used by these customers to help combat terrorism, trade fraud, drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, and illegal immigration. Our products are also used for military force protection and general facility security.
67. Beginning with the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 and continuing with the proliferation of global terrorism, homeland security and force protection concerns have become of paramount importance around the world. The Company believes that homeland defense, force protection and military security initiatives will continue to provide new opportunities, with additional growth in the seaports and borders, federal and military facilities, and corporate security markets.
68. The Companys objective is to distinguish itself from its competitors by offering innovative products which provide customers with superior threat detection and/or improved operating efficiencies. To achieve this objective, AS&E incorporates a variety of X-ray imaging and image processing technologies into its products. A number of the Companys products use our patented Z Backscatter technology. Z Backscatter is a unique X-ray imaging technique that has distinct advantages for the detection of organic or low atomic number (Z) materials such as plastic explosives, composite weapons, and illegal drugs even when concealed by complex backgrounds.
69. The Companys X-ray imaging products utilize several technologies including traditional transmission X-ray technology, our proprietary Z Backscatter technology, Shaped Energy
70. technology and Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD).
71. X-ray imaging devices contain these basic subsystems: X-ray sources, detectors and software. The source generates an X-ray beam that is directed at the object to be scanned (baggage, container, or similar object). When the source X-rays encounter the object, they are either absorbed by the object, pass directly through the object, or scatter off of the object. Dense (high atomic number) materials tend to absorb X-rays. Materials that are less dense (low atomic number) tend to scatter X-rays. The detectors record the intensity of the transmitted or scattered X-rays. Software is then used to interpret the signals from the detectors and to construct and display X-ray images.
72. Transmission images are created from X-rays that pass through the object that is being examined. Medical X-ray images are a type of transmission X-ray. In transmission imaging, the detector measures the relative intensity of the X-rays that pass directly through the object. The degree to which X-rays are transmitted through an object is
73. Table of Contents
74. dependent upon the size of the X-ray source and the composition and quantity of the material in the path of the X-ray beam. Low energy sources are used to scan smaller objects such as parcels and baggage, and high energy sources are used for scanning large items such as trucks and cargo containers. Transmission X-ray images are useful for seeing through the object of interest. A transmission image, however, represents an aggregate of all objects in the path on the beam and can therefore be difficult to interpret.
75. Most of the Companys X-ray systems utilize AS&Es patented Z Backscatter technology. The term Backscatter refers to those X-rays thatscatteroff of the object under examinationbacktoward the X-ray source. Z Backscatter detectors capture these scattered X-rays which are then used to create highly readable, photo-like images.
76. Many threat items are organic in nature and have low atomic numbers. Such items include drugs, explosives, composite weapons, and stowaways. These items tend to scatter X-rays much more so than inorganic materials like steel and other metals. As a result, these organic threat items tend to stand out as bright, visible objects when scanned by a Z Backscatter imaging system.
77. Z Backscatter images complement transmission images and several of the Companys products employ both technologies. The combination of backscatter and transmission images gives the operator more information about the contents of the baggage or container by differentiating dense materials, such as metals, from low-Z materials such as explosives. In addition, the two images enable an inspector to perform a quicker and more thorough examination of the object in question.
78. Two other technologies employed by AS&E are Shaped Energy and Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD). Shaped Energy technology is a specialized form of high energy transmission X-ray which is used in AS&Es OmniView
79. Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD) is a technology which is used to find radioactive materials in vehicles and is an option on selected AS&E detection systems.
80. The Companys products and services can be grouped into five different areas including CargoSearch Inspection Systems, Z Backscatter Systems, ParcelSearch and Personnel Screening Inspection Systems, Contract Research and Development, and Service and Support.
81. The CargoSearch family of systems includes non-intrusive inspection products which are primarily used for the screening of trucks, cars, cargo containers, pallets, and air cargo at locations including border crossings, seaports, military bases, railroad centers, airports, and cargo and transportation hubs. The CargoSearch systems are designed to combat trade fraud, drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, and terrorism. The CargoSearch family includes:
82. : a multi-view, relocatable high-energy cargo and vehicle inspection system. This system combines 6 MeV high-energy transmission imaging and three Z Backscatter X-ray views for left, right and top-side imaging of cargo. OmniView provides side and top-down views of the cargo in a relocatable configuration. OmniView utilizes AS&Es patented Shaped Energy
83. technology to penetrate densely loaded cargo containers. Shaped Energy shapes the high energy spectrum to filter out non-essential radiation, making the system safe for operators and staff and eliminating the need for extensive exclusion zones. High energy 6 MeV transmission X-rays can penetrate 14 inches (35 cm) of steel or 8.5 feet (260 cm) of oil, yet do not require heavy shielding, an exterior building, or standoff zones. The Z Backscatter images are ideal for the detection of organic or low Z materials including explosives, drugs, alcohol, and tobacco that transmission X-rays alone can miss. The Systems multiple Z Backscatter views of the cargo improve detection while facilitating interpretation of the X-ray image. The OmniView Gantry Systems scanning platform operates by moving on rails past stationary vehicles and cargo. The system is bi-directional allowing for a throughput of approximately 25 trucks per hour. OmniView Gantry is ideal for ports, borders, and high-threat facilities.
84. a multi-view, high throughput, drive-through inspection system capable of scanning cars, vans, trucks, and their cargoes for threats and contraband. The relocatable screening system can be configured with one, two or three Z Backscatter X-ray detectors, allowing for left, right and/or top-side imaging of the vehicle under examination. The images produced by the Z Portal are ideal for the detection of organic materials including explosives, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and stowaways. The Z Portal is well-suited for scanning vehicles at border crossings, high threat facilities, and other vehicle entry checkpoints.
85. : a multi-view Z Backscatter inspection system capable of scanning cars, vans, trucks, and their cargo for concealed threats and contraband in a gantry configuration. The relocatable Z Gantry screening system is configured with three Z Backscatter imaging modules, allowing a left, right, and top view of the vehicle under examination. The rail-mounted Z Gantry system moves over the top of stationary vehicles and cargo while scanning for threats and illegal goods such as stowaways, explosives, drugs, and alcohol.
86. Z Backscatter Systems include imaging systems that use Z Backscatter imaging only.
87. : a mobile X-ray screening system built into a commercially available chassis. It utilizes Z Backscatter X-ray technology to produce photo-like images of the contents of a vehicle or cargo container, highlighting organic materials such as plastic explosives or other anomalies. With one-sided, backscatter-only imaging, security officials can use ZBV for screening vehicles, sea containers, and other cargo for terrorist threats, trade fraud, and contraband, simply by driving past the objects. The ZBV can be equipped with Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD) capability. With RTD, the ZBV can produce Z Backscatter images for general screening while simultaneously scanning the object for the presence of radioactive material. The ZBV is available on a variety of chassis in several versions, including a militarized trailer configuration (ZBV Mil Trailer) that is designed for use by the U.S. military.
88. ParcelSearch systems are designed for the non-intrusive X-ray scanning of parcels, baggage, and mail. These systems are primarily located in government facilities, airports, commercial office buildings, high-security federal facilities and convention centers.
89. Personnel screening is a crucial part of any threat detection effort. Today, threats can take the smallest of forms and are often easily hidden on a person. With the advent of suicide bombings, personnel screening has taken on an even more important role. Personnel screening is also important in the effort to intercept prohibited substances, such as drugs and alcohol.
90. : Gemini is a parcel and baggage inspection system which combines AS&Es Z Backscatter technology with dual-energy transmission X-ray to provide enhanced detection for a wide range of threats. Dual-energy transmission is best suited for the detection of threats such as guns and knives, and for identifying wires and other components of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). It also provides some organic and metallic discrimination in uncluttered environments. Z Backscatter imaging provides enhanced detection of organic materials such as explosives and narcotics, which may be missed by transmission-only systems in cluttered baggage. In addition, the complementary photo-like Z Backscatter image makes it easier for security officers to interpret images, thus reducing analysis time and minimizing operator fatigue. During fiscal 2009 the Company introduced two additional Gemini models to customers with a range of tunnel sizes to suit various applications.
91. a personnel screening system for the effective screening for contraband and threats hidden under a persons clothing. SmartCheck simultaneously detects both metallic and non-metallic objects, such as guns and knives, plastic explosives, liquid explosives, composite weapons, drugs and other hidden threats and contraband. Its Z Backscatter image gives the operator an easy-to-read display of where the threat or contraband is hidden, thus eliminating the need for intrusive and time-consuming pat-downs and strip searches. SmartCheck employs proprietary advanced image processing algorithms to enhance privacy, while maintaining a high level of threat detection.
92. : AS&E engages in a variety of contract research and development (CRAD) programs, mostly for agencies of the U.S. government. AS&E pursues CRAD opportunities which it believes provide avenues for advancing our core technologies or developing product offerings for strategic customers or markets.
93. AS&Es highly skilled Field Service Engineers (FSEs) provide support services worldwide. Each FSE has a technical degree in Electrical and/or Mechanical Engineering (or equivalent experience), and is trained in the operation and repair of electronics, hydraulics, pneumatics, mechanics, electrical systems, and computers. FSEs are available 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, and are located at AS&E sites in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and North America. In addition, Technical Support is provided at the Companys headquarters in Billerica, Massachusetts. AS&E provides comprehensive, cost-effective spare parts solutions customized for each system. The Company maintains an inventory of field-replaceable components in various depots around the world in order to meet customer needs for spare parts.
94. AS&E provides comprehensive technical training on all X-ray inspection systems. Our instructors specialize in current threat detection techniques and employ both classroom theory and hands-on training to help clients become expert users of AS&E equipment. Our technical training informs customers about detection technologies and best practices through demonstrations and field activities that simulate real-life threat and contraband encounters. Technical training is included with each system sale and additional training for image analysis, service and maintenance training, and other customized training courses are provided aftermarket to interested customers.
95. Generally, if pending on June 8, 1995, a patent issued in the United States is effective for the longer of 17 years from the date of issue or 20 years from the United States filing date of the earliest non-provisional application upon which the patent is based. If filed after June 8, 1995, a patent is generally effective for a term of 20 years from the United States filing date of the earliest non-provisional application upon which the patent is based. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with applicable local law. While the duration of our patents varies, we believe that the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, and trademarks is an important factor in its business and that its success depends in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel.
96. The Company also has various trademarks registered and pending registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as marks registered and pending registration in various jurisdictions around the world. Company patents and trademarks are carefully reviewed regularly, and those with no foreseeable commercial value are abandoned to eliminate costly maintenance fees. The Company has ongoing research and development efforts and expects to seek additional intellectual property protection in the future.
97. In addition to patents and pending patent applications, the Company uses trade secrets and proprietary know-how in our products. Any of our know-how or trade secrets not protected by a patent could be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor.
98. The Company believes that its patents, proprietary technology, trade secrets, know-how, and trademarks provide substantial protection for the Companys competitive position and the Company intends to aggressively protect its intellectual property assets, by litigation or other means, as appropriate. We have periodically monitored and continue to monitor the activities of our competitors and other third parties with respect to their use of intellectual property. In addition, we require our employees, consultants, outside collaborators, and certain distributors and suppliers to execute confidentiality and, where appropriate, non-competition agreements upon commencing employment or other relationships with us. Nevertheless, there can be no assurances that the steps taken by the Company in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or infringement of its technology or that the Companys competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the Companys technology. Effective protection of intellectual property rights may be limited or unavailable in certain foreign countries. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings below.
99. The Companys products are marketed to corporate and governmental organizations through a sales force that contacts potential customers and responds to public tenders and other expressions of interest. This sales force includes Company personnel based in the United States and abroad, as well as independent representatives under contracts to sell in foreign countries.
100. The Company has a customer base consisting of government and commercial clients from both the United States and abroad. Domestically, the Companys primary client base is comprised of agencies of the U.S. Government. Approximately 56%, 55%, and 70% of the Companys total sales in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, were derived from either (i) contracting directly with the U.S. Government, or (ii) contracting with contractors working directly with the U.S. Government. A significant number of the Companys contracts with the U.S. Government provide the U.S. Government with the standard unilateral right to terminate these contracts for convenience. As discussed under Item 7 of this Annual Report, during fiscal 2009 two of the Companys contracts with the U.S. Government were partially terminated for convenience by the U. S. Government. These partial terminations did not result in any material losses to the Company. The Company is heavily dependent upon sales to agencies of the U.S. Government and reductions or delays in procurement of the Companys systems and services by these agencies may have a material adverse effect on the Company.
101. International sales, primarily to foreign governments, accounted for approximately 37%, 36%, and 27% of the Companys total sales in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 respectively, and continue to be a high priority for the Company as part of its long-term growth strategy. International sales entail longer sales cycles and project financing requirements; however the Company continues to focus on these sales as a means of broadening its customer base. The Company manages its overseas risk in a number of ways, including actively increasing the number of opportunities it is pursuing at any one time and obtaining downpayments and letters of credit to secure its international receivables. The majority of international contracts are bid in U.S.
102. dollars. For those contracts that are bid in other currencies, the Company considers the need to engage in hedging contracts to control foreign exchange risk. There were no hedging activities in fiscal 2009, 2008, or 2007.
103. In fiscal 2009, the Company had sales to two major customers, one agency of the U.S. Government and one international government, which accounted for 18% and 16% of total sales, respectively. In fiscal 2008, the Company had sales to two major customers, both agencies of the U.S. Government, which accounted for 12% and 10% of total sales. In fiscal 2007, the Company had sales to two major customers, both agencies of the U.S. Government, which accounted for 31% and 15% of total sales.
104. The Company has many competitors in the homeland security X-ray detection market, including several large and well-established manufacturers of security equipment with financial and other resources greater than those of the Company. Certain X-ray security system customers select such systems based largely on price. Other customers, including some agencies of the U.S. Government and certain users in countries with high levels of concern over security, tend to select systems based largely on detection capability. Many of the Companys systems offer premium performance and have in some cases been priced higher than competing systems. The Company believes that its patented and proprietary technology give it a strong competitive position in the sale of security systems to customers concerned with performance and detection. The Company also believes that its strategy of concentrating on products with unique features, including Z Backscatter and Shaped Energy, and/or competitive pricing will give it a strong position to increase its sales of X-ray inspection systems. However, a number of companies have developed products that compete with the Companys X-ray inspection products. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors)
105. In August 2006, the Companys Quality Management System was recertified under the ISO 9001:2000 Standard of the International Organization for Standardization which it has been registered under since 2003. ISO 9001 is an internationally recognized quality management and assurance standard. In qualifying, the Company met or exceeded the standards for establishing a quality management system for preventing non-conformity at every level of the product life cycle, from customer order, through development and production, to installation and support. The Company believes that demonstrating continuous quality improvement is vital for building customer satisfaction and making business processes more efficient in order to increase its competitive edge.
106. Critical material and subsystems are procured from both domestic suppliers and global supply partners. These supply sources are in several cases, involving key components, single sources of supply and the material provided can have extended lead times. In response to expanding customer demand in the global security screening market, the Company has taken steps to mitigate sourcing risks by working closely with its suppliers to ensure future material and subsystem availability to support its production plans. In some cases, the Company has chosen to stock reserve material to ensure future availability. Efforts have also included identifying and qualifying second source suppliers for critical material and a number of key subsystems in support of its product lines. The Company does not expect to experience sustained difficulties in securing required material and subsystems to support its future business operations.
107. AS&E must comply with applicable federal regulations under Title 21 CFR Subchapter J - Radiological Health. To the Companys knowledge, all AS&E cabinet X-ray products comply with all applicable U.S. Government radiation safety performance standards including 21 CFR 1020.40. To the Companys knowledge, all personnel inspection systems of AS&E comply with the voluntary consensus radiation safety standards adopted by the American National Standards Institute ANSI N43.17-2002.
108. The Company spent approximately $18,070,000 of its own funds for research and development during fiscal 2009, compared to $12,306,000 and $7,184,000 in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The fiscal 2009 research and development efforts were focused on new product development, the development of new applications, and design modifications and enhancements to existing products.
109. In addition, the Company conducted government-sponsored research primarily focused on advances in X-ray systems, image analysis and integrated system development for niche security inspection problems. The Company recognized revenues of $12,524,000, $13,978,000, and $6,597,000 in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively for these efforts. Many of the Companys government sponsored research and development contracts provide for a fixed fee or a reimbursement of allowable costs plus a
110. fixed fee. The Companys contracts in these areas are obtained by submitting research and development proposals to various organizations, sometimes in response to requests for such proposals.
111. As of March 31, 2009 the Company had 375 employees as compared to 346 employees at March 31, 2008. It is the Companys policy to have employees sign a non-compete and non-disclosure agreement as a condition of employment. None of the Companys employees are represented by labor unions.
112. The Companys firm (signed contracts) sales backlog was $155,349,000, $99,606,000, and $105,634,000 at March 31, 2009, March 31, 2008, and March 31, 2007, respectively.
113. A significant number of the Companys contracts with the U.S. Government contain clauses permitting the government to terminate the contract for convenience upon certain terms and conditions, including partial payment to the Company for work performed. This right was exercised in fiscal 2009 by two U.S. Government agencies who were parties to the contract. Total contracts with U.S Government agencies and subcontractors in the backlog were $71,545,000, $42,640,000, and $58,833,000, at March 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. It is estimated that approximately 82% of the 2009 backlog will be converted within the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010.
114. Most export sales are transacted in U.S. dollars, and most are either secured by irrevocable letters of credit or paid in advance. The following table shows the breakdown of net sales and contract revenues to international and domestic customers based upon the customers country of domicile and the major regions of international activity. All assets are maintained within the United States with the exception of inventory depots, inventory in transit or awaiting installation and cash accounts maintained at foreign locations (approximately 5.3% of the Companys assets).
115. International
116. Middle East & Africa
117. Pacific Rim
118. The Companys principal executive offices are located at 829 Middlesex Turnpike, Billerica, MA 01821; telephone number 978-262-8700; corporate website www.as-e.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual Form 10-K, current reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as practicable. In addition, our reports, proxy and information statements and other information filed with the SEC are available at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549 (1-800-SEC-0330), and are also available from the SECs website at www.sec.gov.
119. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of the following risks occur, the Companys business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
120. The Companys business is dependent on sales to a small number of customers, which include agencies of the United States government. During fiscal 2009, two customers accounted for 34% of the Companys total revenues. During fiscal 2008, two customers accounted for 22% of the Companys total revenues and during fiscal 2007, two customers accounted for 46% of the Companys total revenues. The Company can provide no assurance that its existing customers will increase or maintain their level of demand for the Companys products.
121. A significant number of the Companys government contracts may be terminated at the governments discretion. During fiscal 2009, two of the Companys contracts with the U.S. Government were partially terminated for convenience by the U.S. Government. Although these partial terminations did not result in material losses to the Company, future contract terminations could negatively impact the Companys results of operations. The termination of the Companys relationship with one or more of its significant customers or the reduction or delay of orders of its systems by these customers would substantially reduce the Companys revenues, and its business and prospects may be harmed.
122. The Companys results of operations may be materially adversely affected by the conditions in the global economy and the impact of those conditions on U.S. and foreign government spending. The global economic recession has caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets, including a significant reduction in the availability of capital resources to many business enterprises. U.S. and foreign economies have experienced and continue to experience significant declines in employment, spending, household wealth and lending. Businesses have faced and may continue to face weakened demand for their products and services, difficulty obtaining access to financing, increased funding costs, and barriers to expanding operations. U.S. and foreign government spending for programs involving products such as the Companys may be reduced or delayed, now or in the future, due to reduced tax revenues and other spending imperatives, including financial institution support and economic stimulus programs. Economic and market conditions may continue to worsen and could negatively impact the Companys results of operations.
123. The Companys largest customers are government agencies and demand for its products is dependent upon national priorities and governmental initiatives. These priorities and initiatives are subject to change from time to time in response to the economic and political environment. The Company is also exposed to budget approval and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events and macroeconomic conditions, and are beyond our control. While the overall level of U.S. defense spending has increased in recent years for numerous reasons, we can give no assurance that such spending will continue to grow, or not be reduced. Significant changes in defense spending could have long-term consequences for our size and structure. In addition, changes in government priorities and requirements could impact the funding, or the timing of funding, of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
124. A substantial portion of the Companys sales depends upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand security at border crossing inspection sites, existing airports, seaports and other facilities. Accordingly, a portion of the Companys product sales is subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes that often accompany such capital expenditures. During these approval periods, the Company expends significant financial and managerial resources in anticipation of future orders that may not occur. If the Company fails to receive an order after expending these resources, it may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to recover the costs incurred and its business and prospects may be harmed.
125. The Companys revenues to international customers, including foreign governments, accounted for approximately 37%, 36% and 27% of its net revenues for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2009, March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2007, respectively, and a significant number of domestic customer orders require shipments to, and services provided in, overseas locations. In addition, the Company transacts business internationally with a number of its key suppliers. As a result of the Companys worldwide business operations, it is subject to various risks, including:
126. international regulatory requirements and policy changes;
127. lengthy sales cycles;
128. longer payment cycles by foreign customers;
129. difficulties in inventory management, accounts receivable collection and the management of distributors or representatives;
130. difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;
131. geopolitical instability;
132. political and economic changes and disruptions;
133. favoritism towards local suppliers;
134. governmental currency controls;
135. interruption to transportation flow for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;
136. currency exchange rate fluctuations; and
137. tariff regulations.
138. Although the Companys international sales have been denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates that increase the relative value of the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult for the Company to compete with foreign manufacturers on price or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its sales and operating results.
139. The Company competes in markets in which the Company or its customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as health and safety regulations. The Company develops, configures and markets its products to meet its customers needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for the Companys products or increase its costs to comply with new regulations, both of which may adversely affect its operating results.
140. The Company relies on a number of suppliers to provide material and subsystems for our products. The Company is reliant on a limited number of key international supply partners for core technology products, including subsystems with complex sub-tier supply chains. In addition, certain material or subsystems used in our products may be available from a sole source or limited number of suppliers, increasing the risk of supply disruption. Although our products may be able to be redesigned to avoid using any sole source supplier, it would be expensive and time consuming to make such a change. If the Company changes any of its suppliers, a qualification process would need to be completed and the affected product may require redesign, creating potential delays in product shipments.
141. Some of our suppliers may allocate material due to market demand for the products they produce or market constraints such as the global availability of raw materials. We have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and there can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet our requirements. Many of our competitors are much larger and may be able to obtain priority allocations from these shared suppliers, thereby limiting or making our sources of supply unreliable for these components. There is also the possibility that a key single source supplier may be acquired by or form a strategic alignment with a competitor, which could impact our ability to secure required materials. If our supply of materials is disrupted, we cannot ensure that we would be able to find another supplier on a timely basis.
142. The Company depends on its subcontractors and suppliers to deliver material that is in full compliance with critical quality and specification requirements. Quality issues may affect the reliability and performance of our products, customer confidence, and adversely impact financial performance. Any difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of conforming material could result in delays or reductions in product shipments that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and consolidated results of operations. This in turn could also damage our reputation in the market and cause us to lose market share. The Company does not expect to experience sustained difficulties in securing required material and subsystems to support forward business operations.
143. Given the nature of the markets in which the Company participates, and given the right of key customers to terminate contracts at their discretion, it cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability. A high proportion of the Companys costs are fixed, due in part to its significant sales, research and development, and manufacturing costs. As a result of its fixed costs, even small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect the Companys operating results and stock price at any time. Factors that may affect the Companys quarterly operating results and the market price of its common stock include:
144. demand for and market acceptance of its X-ray inspection systems;
145. lengthy sales cycles and the effect of large orders;
146. termination of contracts and contractual awards at the customers convenience;
147. changes in political agendas or national priorities;
148. adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which the Company does business;
149. political unrest in the regions where the Company transacts business;
150. adverse changes in industries on which the Company is particularly dependent;
151. competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices for its products;
152. delays or problems in the introduction of new products;
153. the Companys competitors announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations;
154. variations in the Companys product mix;
155. the timing and amount of the Companys expenditures in anticipation of future sales;
156. increased costs of raw materials or supplies; and
157. changes in the volume or timing of product orders.
158. If the Companys X-ray inspection systems fail to detect the presence of bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats to personal safety, the Company could be subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could result in increased costs, reduced sales, and a decline in the market price of the Companys common stock. There are many factors beyond the Companys control that could result in the failure of its products to detect the presence of bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats to personal safety. Examples of these factors include operator error or misuse of or malfunction of its equipment. The failure of the Companys systems to detect the presence of these dangerous materials may lead to personal injury, loss of life, and extensive property damage and may result in potential claims against the Company.
159. The Companys product liability and umbrella liability insurance may be insufficient to protect it from product liability claims. Moreover, there is a risk that product liability insurance will not continue to be available to the Company at a reasonable cost, if at all. If liability claims exceed the Companys current or available insurance coverage, its business and prospects may be harmed. Regardless of the adequacy of the Companys product liability insurance protection, any significant claim may have an adverse affect on its industry and market reputation, leading to a substantial decrease in demand for its products and reduced revenues.
160. The Company generates funds for its research and development activities from operations, private sources and the government. The Company may be unable to generate the funds necessary to support its research and development activities if it does not generate sufficient funds from operations, other potential private sources, or the government. The Company may not successfully compete with other companies and research institutions for government funding and funding from other private sources. Additionally, government-funding priorities are subject to frequent changes. For example, in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company recorded $12,524,000, $13,978,000 and $6,597,000, respectively, for government-sponsored research and
161. development. There is no guarantee that the Company will receive funds for government-sponsored research in the future. If the Company is unable to fund its research and development activities through its operations or from outside sources, the Company may be unable to continue to innovate or bring its innovations to market on a timely or cost effective basis, or its innovations may be surpassed by other competitors or new technologies.
162. The Companys continuing research and development program is designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve its current products. The Company plans to expend significant resources on the development of its new products. The successful development of its products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:
163. unanticipated delays;
164. access to capital;
165. budget overruns;
166. technical problems; and
167. other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design, development and commercialization of new products and product enhancements, including for example, changes requested or required by governmental and regulatory agencies.
168. Given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction of X-ray inspection systems, the Company cannot assure that its product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget, if at all. The Companys failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget would harm its business and prospects.
169. The market for the Companys products has been characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions and evolving industry standards and customer requirements. The Company believes that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future. The Companys success will depend, in part, upon its ability to enhance its existing products, successfully develop new products that meet changing customer and regulatory requirements and gain market acceptance. If the Company fails to do so, its products may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology, in which case its revenue and operating results would suffer. In developing any new product, the Company may be required to make a substantial investment before it can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If the Company fails to accurately foresee its customers needs and future activities, it may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue.
170. A number of companies have developed products that compete with the Companys X-ray inspection products. Many of the Companys competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than it does. Some of its competitors have more extensive research, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and greater technical and personnel resources than the Company does, and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry. The Companys failure to compete successfully could decrease demand for its products or make its products obsolete.
171. In the inspection systems market, competition is based primarily on the following factors:
172. product performance, functionality and quality;
173. the overall cost of ownership of the system;
174. prior customer relationships;
175. technological capabilities of the product;
176. certification by government authorities;
177. local market presence; and
178. breadth of the sales and service organization.
179. To remain competitive, the Company must develop new products and periodically enhance its existing products in a timely manner. The Company anticipates that it may have to adjust the prices of some of its products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors may emerge, and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines.
180. The Company relies primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and confidentiality procedures to protect its technology. Despite its precautions, the steps the Company has taken to protect its technology may be inadequate. Existing trade secret, patent, trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection. The Companys patents could be invalidated or circumvented. In addition, others may develop substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology, or competitors may offer equivalent products in competition with the Companys products, thereby substantially reducing the value of the Companys proprietary rights. The laws of some foreign countries in which the Companys products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not protect its products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. This may make the possibility of piracy of the Companys technology and products more likely. The Company cannot assure that the steps it has taken to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology. The Companys inability to protect its intellectual property could have a negative impact on its operations and financial results.
181. Initiating or defending against the enforcement of the Companys intellectual property rights may result in significant, protracted, and costly litigation. The Company has previously been and continues to be involved in various litigations involving its intellectual property and has been successful in protecting such interests to date. The Company expects intellectual property disputes to be an ordinary part of its business for the foreseeable future. The Company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of its intellectual property rights, or to establish the validity of its property rights. There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in any such action. Litigation by or against the Company could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation results in a favorable outcome for the Company. In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, the Company could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, discontinue the use of certain processes, or obtain licenses for the infringing technology. If a license were required, the Company cannot assure that it would be able to obtain one on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The Company cannot assure that it will be successful in developing non-infringing technology or that the cost or time required to develop such technology will be reasonable.
182. The Companys future success depends in large measure upon the continued contributions of its senior management team and other key personnel. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain key personnel or executive management in sufficient numbers, with the requisite skills or on acceptable terms necessary or advisable to support our continued growth. If we lose professionals or are unable to attract new talent, we will not be able to maintain our position in the market or grow our business.
183. The Company may require additional capital to finance continuing operations. The Company cannot assure that operations will continue to be profitable, that it will generate levels of revenues and cash flows sufficient to fund operations, or, if necessary, that the Company will be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any existing financing arrangements may not be available or sufficient to meet the Companys cash needs or may not be available in the future, or, if available, at a cost that the Company believes is reasonable.
184. Substantially all of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock are freely tradable without restriction or further registration. Affiliates must sell all shares they own in compliance with the volume and other requirements of Rule 144.
185. Nevertheless, sales of substantial amounts of common stock by the Companys stockholders, or even the potential for such sales, may cause the market price of the Companys common stock to decline and could impair the Companys ability to raise capital through the sale of the Companys equity securities.
186. The market price of the Companys common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. The Company believes that a variety of factors could cause the price of the Companys common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:
187. announcements of developments related to the Companys business;
188. quarterly fluctuations in the Companys actual or anticipated operating results and order levels;
189. general conditions in the worldwide economy;
190. announcements of technological innovations;
191. new products or product enhancements by the Company or its competitors;
192. developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; and
193. developments in the Companys relationships with its customers and suppliers.
194. In addition, in recent years the stock market in general, and the markets for shares of small capitalization and high-tech companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of the Companys common stock.
195. Provisions in the Companys articles of organization and the Companys shareholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control. These provisions could limit the price that acquirers might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Companys common stock. Specifically, the Companys articles of organization authorize its Board of Directors to issue up to 100,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to fix certain rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued shares of preferred stock, to fix the number of shares constituting any such series, and to fix the designation of any such series, without further vote or action by its shareholders. The terms of any series of preferred stock, which may include priority claims to assets and dividends and special voting rights, could adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock and thereby reduce the value of the Companys common stock. The Company has no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock. The Company has in place a shareholder rights plan, which was renewed in April of 2008, under which its stockholders are entitled to purchase shares of its preferred stock under certain circumstances. These circumstances include the purchase of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock by a person or group, or the announcement of a tender or exchange offer to acquire 15% or more of the outstanding common stock. The shareholder rights plan may have the effect of impeding or preventing certain types of transactions involving a change in control of the Company that could be beneficial to the stockholders.

52. Transmission X-ray Technology:Transmission images are created from X-rays that pass through the object that is being examined. Medical X-ray images are a type of transmission X-ray. In transmission imaging, the detector measures the relative intensity of the X-rays that pass directly through the object. The degree to which X-rays are transmitted through an object is dependant upon the size of the X-ray source and the composition and quantity of the material in the path of the X-ray beam. Low energy sources are used to scan smaller objects such as parcels and baggage, and high energy sources are used for scanning large
53. Z Backscatter Technology:Most of the Companys X-ray systems utilize AS&Es patented Z Backscatter technology. The term Backscatter refers to those X-rays thatscatteroff of the object under examinationbacktoward the X-ray source. Z Backscatter detectors capture these scattered X-rays which are then used to create highly readable, photo-like images.
54. Other Technologies:Two other technologies employed by AS&E are Shaped Energy and Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD). Shaped Energy technology is a specialized form of high energy transmission X-ray which is used in AS&Es OmniView product line. Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD) is a technology which is used to find radioactive materials in vehicles.
55. CargoSearch Inspection Systems:The CargoSearch family of systems includes non-intrusive inspection products which are primarily used for the screening of trucks, cars, cargo containers, pallets, and air cargo at locations including border crossings, seaports, military bases, railroad centers, airports, and cargo and transportation hubs. The CargoSearch systems are designed to combat trade fraud, drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, and terrorism. The CargoSearch family includes:
56. Z Backscatter Systems:Z Backscatter Systems include imaging systems that use Z Backscatter imaging only.
57. ParcelSearchInspection Systems:ParcelSearch systems are designed for the non-intrusive X-ray scanning of parcels, baggage, and mail. These systems are primarily located in government facilities, airports, commercial office buildings, high-security federal facilities and convention centers. ParcelSearch systems include:
58. Personnel Screening:Personnel screening is a crucial part of any threat detection effort. Today, threats can take the smallest of forms and are often easily hidden on a person. With the advent of suicide bombings, personnel screening has taken on an even more important role. Personnel screening is also important in the effort to intercept prohibited substances, such as drugs and alcohol.
59. Contract Research & Development: AS&E engages in a variety of contract research and development (CRAD) programs, mostly for agencies of the U.S. government. AS&E pursues CRAD opportunities which it believes provide avenues for advancing our core technologies or developing product offerings for strategic customers or markets.
60. Service and Support:AS&Es highly skilled Field Service Engineers (FSEs) provide support services worldwide. Each FSE has a technical degree in Electrical and/or Mechanical Engineering (or equivalent experience), and is trained in the operation and repair of electronics, hydraulics, pneumatics, mechanics, electrical systems, and computers. FSEs are available 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, and are located at AS&E offices in Asia, Central America, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. In addition, Technical Support is provided at the Companys headquarters in Billerica, Massachusetts. AS&E provides comprehensive, cost-effective spare parts solutions customized for each system. The Company maintains an inventory of field-replaceable components in order to meet customer needs for spare parts.
61. All references in this Annual report to AS&E, the Company, we, our and us means American Science and Engineering, Inc. and its subsidiary.
62. American Science and Engineering, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation formed in 1958, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells X-ray inspection and other inspection solutions for homeland security and other targeted markets. AS&E®provides maintenance, warranty, research, engineering, and training services related to these solutions.
63. The Company manufactures sophisticated X-ray inspection products that can be used to inspect parcels, baggage, vehicles, pallets, cargo containers, and people. The Company sells its products in the United States and throughout the world to a variety of customers, including:
64. Authorities responsible for port and border security
65. Aviation security agencies
66. Military organizations; and
67. High threat commercial and government facilities
68. AS&Es products are used by these customers to help combat terrorism, trade fraud, drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, and illegal immigration. Our products are also used for military force protection and general facility security.
69. Beginning with the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and continuing with the proliferation of global terrorism, homeland security and force protection concerns have become of paramount importance in the United States and around the world. The Company believes that homeland defense, force protection and military security initiatives will continue to provide new revenue opportunities, with additional growth in the seaports and borders, federal and military facilities, and corporate security markets.
70. The Companys objective is to distinguish itself from its competitors by offering innovative products which provide superior threat detection. To achieve this, AS&E incorporates a variety of X-ray imaging and image processing technologies into its products. A number of the Companys products use our patented Z Backscatter technology. Z Backscatter is a unique X-ray imaging technique that has distinct advantages for the detection of organic or low atomic number (Z) materials such as plastic explosives, composite weapons, and illegal drugs even when concealed by complex backgrounds.
71. The Companys X-ray imaging products utilize several technologies including traditional transmission X-ray technology, our proprietary Z Backscatter technology, Shaped Energy technology and Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD).
72. X-ray imaging devices contain these basic subsystems: X-ray sources, detectors, and software. The source generates an X-ray beam that is directed at the object to be scanned (baggage, container, etc.). When the source X-rays encounter the object, they are either absorbed by the object, pass directly through the object, or scatter off of the object. Dense (high atomic number) materials tend to absorb X-rays. Materials that are less dense (low atomic number) tend to scatter X-rays. The detectors record the intensity of the transmitted or scattered X-rays. Software is then used to interpret the signals from the detectors and to construct and display X-ray images.
73. Transmission images are created from X-rays that pass through the object that is being examined. Medical X-ray images are a type of transmission X-ray. In transmission imaging, the detector measures the relative intensity of the X-rays that pass directly through the object. The degree to which X-rays are transmitted through an object is dependant upon the size of the X-ray source and the composition and quantity of the material in the path of the X-ray beam. Low energy sources are used to scan smaller objects such as parcels and baggage, and high energy sources are used for scanning large
74. Most of the Companys X-ray systems utilize AS&Es patented Z Backscatter technology. The term Backscatter refers to those X-rays thatscatteroff of the object under examinationbacktoward the X-ray source. Z Backscatter detectors capture these scattered X-rays which are then used to create highly readable, photo-like images.
75. Many threat items are organic in nature and have low atomic numbers. Such items include drugs, explosives, composite weapons, and stowaways. These items tend to scatter X-rays much more so than inorganic materials like steel and other metals. As a result, these organic threat items tend to stand out as bright, visible objects when scanned by a Z Backscatter imaging system.
76. Z Backscatter images complement transmission images and several of the Companys products employ both technologies. The combination of backscatter and transmission images gives security officials more information about the contents of the baggage or container by differentiating dense materials, such as metals, from low-Z materials such as explosives. In addition, the two images enable an inspector to perform a quicker and more thorough examination of the object in question.
77. Two other technologies employed by AS&E are Shaped Energy and Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD). Shaped Energy technology is a specialized form of high energy transmission X-ray which is used in AS&Es OmniView product line. Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD) is a technology which is used to find radioactive materials in vehicles.
78. The Companys products and services can be grouped into six different areas including CargoSearch Inspection Systems, Z Backscatter Systems, ParcelSearch Inspection Systems, Personnel Inspection, Contract Research and Development, and Service and Support.
79. The CargoSearch family of systems includes non-intrusive inspection products which are primarily used for the screening of trucks, cars, cargo containers, pallets, and air cargo at locations including border crossings, seaports, military bases, railroad centers, airports, and cargo and transportation hubs. The CargoSearch systems are designed to combat trade fraud, drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, and terrorism. The CargoSearch family includes:
80. : a multi-view, relocatable high-energy cargo and vehicle inspection system. This system combines 6 MeV high-energy transmission imaging and three Z Backscatter X-ray views for left, right and top-side imaging of cargo. OmniView provides side and top-down views of the cargo in a relocatable configuration. OmniView utilizes AS&Es patented Shaped Energy technology to penetrate densely loaded cargo containers. Shaped Energy shapes the high energy spectrum to filter out non-essential radiation, making the system safe for operators and staff. High energy 6.0 MeV transmission X-rays can penetrate 14 inches (35 cm) of steel or 8.5 feet (260 cm) of oil, yet doesnt require heavy shielding, an exterior building, or standoff zones. The Z Backscatter images are ideal for the detection of organic or low Z materials including explosives, drugs, alcohol, and tobacco that transmission X-rays alone can miss. The Systems multiple Z Backscatter views of the cargo improve detection while facilitating interpretation of the X-ray image. The OmniView Gantry Systems scanning platform operates by moving on rails past stationary vehicles and cargo. The system is bi-directional allowing for a throughput of approximately 25 trucks per hour. OmniView Gantry is ideal for ports, borders, and high-threat military facilities.
81. a multi-view, high throughput, drive-through inspection system capable of scanning cars, vans, trucks, and their cargoes for threats and contraband. The relocatable screening system can be configured with one, two or three Z Backscatter X-ray detectors, allowing for left, right and/or top-side imaging of the vehicle under examination. The images produced by the Z Portal are ideal for the detection of organic materials including explosives, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and stowaways. The Z Portal is well-suited for scanning vehicles at border crossings, high threat facilities, and other vehicle entry checkpoints.
82. : a conveyorized X-ray inspection system designed to perform non-intrusive inspection of mixed cargo shipped on large pallets or in air cargo containers. The system is especially useful for inspecting large, irregularly shaped containers and cargo.
83. Z Backscatter Systems include imaging systems that use Z Backscatter imaging only.
84. : a mobile X-ray screening system built into a commercially available chassis. It utilizes Z Backscatter X-ray technology to produce photo-like images of the contents of a vehicle or cargo container, highlighting organic materials such as plastic explosives or other anomalies. With one-sided, backscatter-only imaging, security officials can use
85. ZBV for screening vehicles, sea containers, and other cargo for terrorist threats, trade fraud, and contraband, simply by driving past the objects. The ZBV can be equipped with Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD) capability. With RTD, the ZBV can produce Z Backscatter images for general screening while simultaneously scanning the object for the presence of radioactive material. The ZBV is available in several versions, including a militarized trailer configuration (ZBV Mil Trailer) that is designed for use by the U.S. military.
86. ParcelSearch systems are designed for the non-intrusive X-ray scanning of parcels, baggage, and mail. These systems are primarily located in government facilities, airports, commercial office buildings, high-security federal facilities and convention centers. ParcelSearch systems include:
87. : Gemini is a parcel and baggage inspection system which combines AS&Es Z Backscatter technology with Dual-energy transmission X-ray to provide enhanced detection for a wide range of threats. Dual-energy transmission is best suited for the detection of threats such as guns and knives, and for identifying wires and other components of improvised explosive devises (IEDs). It also provides some organic and metallic discrimination in uncluttered environments. Z Backscatter imaging provides enhanced detection of organic materials such as explosives and narcotics, which may be missed by transmission-only systems in cluttered baggage. In addition, the complementary photo-like Z Backscatter image makes it easier for security officers to interpret images, thus reducing analysis time and minimizing operator fatigue.
88. a self-contained conveyor-based parcel inspection system housed in a standard van; designed and built to the rigorous specifications of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
89. :conveyor-based systems allowing rapid inspection of high volumes of luggage and other packages.
90. Personnel screening is a crucial part of any threat detection effort. Today, threats can take the smallest of forms and are often easily hidden on a person. With the advent of suicide bombings, personnel screening has taken on an even more important role. Personnel screening is also important in the effort to intercept prohibited substances, such as drugs and alcohol.
91. : a personnel screening system for the effective screening for contraband and threats hidden under a persons clothing. SmartCheck simultaneously detects both metallic and non-metallic objects, such as guns and knives, plastic explosives, liquid explosives, composite weapons, drugs and other hidden threats and contraband. Its Z Backscatter image gives the operator an easy-to-read display of where the threat or contraband is hidden, thus eliminating the need for intrusive and time-consuming pat-downs and strip searches. SmartCheck employs proprietary advanced image processing algorithms to enhance privacy, while maintaining a high level of threat detection.
92. : AS&E engages in a variety of contract research and development (CRAD) programs, mostly for agencies of the U.S. government. AS&E pursues CRAD opportunities which it believes provide avenues for advancing our core technologies or developing product offerings for strategic customers or markets.
93. AS&Es highly skilled Field Service Engineers (FSEs) provide support services worldwide. Each FSE has a technical degree in Electrical and/or Mechanical Engineering (or equivalent experience), and is trained in the operation and repair of electronics, hydraulics, pneumatics, mechanics, electrical systems, and computers. FSEs are available 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, and are located at AS&E offices in Asia, Central America, Europe, the Middle East, and North America. In addition, Technical Support is provided at the Companys headquarters in Billerica, Massachusetts. AS&E provides comprehensive, cost-effective spare parts solutions customized for each system. The Company maintains an inventory of field-replaceable components in order to meet customer needs for spare parts.
94. AS&E provides comprehensive technical training on all X-ray inspection systems. Our instructors specialize in current threat detection techniques and employ both classroom theory and hands-on training to help clients become expert users of AS&E equipment. Our technical training informs customers about detection technologies and best practices through demonstrations and field activities that simulate real-life threat and contraband encounters. Technical training is included with each system sale and additional training for image analysis, service and maintenance training, and other customized training courses are provided aftermarket to interested customers.
95. The Company relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, contract and trade secret laws to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its technology. The Company has patents either issued and/or pending in the United States, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, China, Austria, France, Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Hong Kong, India, Israel, The Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Mexico,
96. Norway, The Russian Federation, Ukraine, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Thailand and Egypt, and under the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Patent Cooperation Treaty.
97. In general, the Company pursues a policy of obtaining patent protection both in the United States and in selected foreign countries for subject matter we consider patentable and important to our business strategy. The Company has 63 unexpired patents issued by, and 59 patent applications pending with, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as with the respective patent offices of the foreign countries noted above. Over half of our issued patents have been issued in the last five years.
98. Generally, patents issued in the United States are effective for the longer of 17 years from the date of issue or 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the corresponding patent application if filed prior to June 8, 1995. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with applicable local law. While the duration of our patents varies, we believe that the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.
99. The Company believes that its patents, proprietary technology, know-how, and trademarks provide substantial protection for the Companys competitive position and the Company intends to aggressively protect its intellectual property assets, by litigation or other means, as appropriate. Nevertheless, there can be no assurances that the steps taken by the Company in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or infringement of its technology or that the Companys competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the Companys technology. Effective protection of intellectual property rights may be limited or unavailable in certain foreign countries. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings below.
100. The Companys X-ray products are marketed to corporate and governmental organizations through a sales force that contacts potential customers and responds to public tenders and other expressions of interest. This sales force includes Company personnel based in the United States and abroad, as well as independent representatives under contracts to sell in foreign countries.
101. The Company has a customer base consisting of government and commercial clients from both the United States and abroad. Domestically, the Companys primary client base is comprised of agencies of the U.S. Government. Approximately 55%, 70%, and 77% of the Companys total sales in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, were derived from either (i) contracting directly with the U.S. Government, or (ii) contracting with contractors working directly with the U.S. Government. Certain of the Companys contracts with the U.S. Government provide the U.S. Government with the standard unilateral right to terminate these contracts for convenience. To date, the Company has not experienced any material losses as a result of this contractual provision. The Company is heavily dependent upon sales to agencies of the U.S. Government and reductions or delays in procurement of the Companys systems and services by these agencies may have a material adverse effect on the Company.
102. International sales, primarily to foreign governments, accounted for approximately 36%, 27%, and 14% of the Companys total sales in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively, and continue to be a high priority for the Company as part of its long-term growth strategy. International sales entail longer sales cycles and project financing requirements; however the Company continues to focus on these sales as a means of broadening its customer base and reducing its dependency on sales to the U.S. Government. The Company manages its overseas risk in a number of ways, including actively increasing the number of opportunities it is pursuing at any one time, working with international funding sources to help customers finance and secure funding of these projects, and obtaining downpayments and letters of credit to secure its international receivables. The majority of international contracts are bid in U.S. dollars. For those contracts that are bid in other currencies, the Company considers the need to engage in hedging contracts to control foreign exchange risk. There were no hedging activities in fiscal 2008, 2007, or 2006.
103. In fiscal 2008, the Company had sales to two major customers, both agencies of the U.S. Government, which accounted for 12% and 10% of total sales. In fiscal 2007, the Company had sales to two major customers, both agencies of the U.S. Government, which accounted for 31% and 15% of total sales. In fiscal 2006, these same customers accounted for 26% and 30% of total sales.
104. The Company has many competitors in the homeland security X-ray detection market, including several large and well-established manufacturers of security equipment with financial and other resources greater than those of the Company. Certain X-ray security system customers select such systems based largely on price. Other customers, including some agencies of the U.S. Government and certain users in countries with high levels of concern over security, tend to select systems based largely on detection capability. Many of the Companys systems offer premium performance and have in some cases been priced higher than many competing systems. The Company believes that its patented and proprietary technology give it a strong competitive position in the sale of security systems to customers concerned with performance and detection. The Company also believes that its strategy
105. of concentrating on products with unique features, including Z Backscatter and Shaped Energy, and/or competitive pricing will give it a strong position to increase its sales of X-ray systems. However, a number of companies have developed products that compete with the Companys X-ray inspection products. (See Forward-Looking Information and Factors Affecting Future Performance)
106. In August 2006, the Companys Quality Management System was recertified under the ISO 9001:2000 Standard of the International Organization for Standardization which it has been registered under since 2003. ISO 9001 is an internationally recognized quality management and assurance standard.
107. In qualifying, the Company met or exceeded the standards for establishing a quality management system for preventing non-conformity at every level of the product life cycle, from customer order, through development and production, to installation and support.
108. The Company believes that demonstrating continuous quality improvement is vital for building customer satisfaction and making business processes more efficient in order to increase its competitive edge.
109. Critical material and subsystems are procured from both domestic suppliers as well as internationally from global supply partners. These supply sources are in some cases single sources of supply and the material provided can have extended lead times. In response to expanding customer demand in the global security screening market, the Company has taken steps to mitigate sourcing risks by working closely with its suppliers to ensure future material and subsystem availability to support its production plans. In some cases, the Company has chosen to stock reserve material to ensure future availability. Efforts have also included identifying and qualifying second source suppliers for critical material and a number of key subsystems in support of its product lines. The Company does not expect to experience sustained difficulties in securing required material and subsystems to support its forward business operations.

114. The Company spent approximately $12,306,000 of its own funds for research and development during fiscal 2008, compared to $7,184,000 and $9,601,000 in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. The fiscal 2008 research and development efforts were focused on design modifications and enhancements to existing products, the development of new applications and the development of new products.
115. In addition, the Company conducted government-sponsored research primarily focused on advances in X-ray systems, image analysis and integrated system development for niche security inspection problems. The Company recognized revenues of $13,978,000, $6,597,000, and $2,804,000 in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively for these efforts. Many of the Companys government sponsored research and development contracts provide for a fixed fee or a reimbursement of allowable costs plus a fixed fee. The Companys contracts in these areas are obtained by submitting research and development proposals to various organizations, sometimes in response to requests for such proposals.
116. As of March 31, 2008 the Company had 346 employees as compared to 299 employees at March 31, 2007. It is the Companys policy to have employees sign nondisclosure agreements as a condition of employment. None of the Companys employees are represented by labor unions.
117. The Companys firm (signed contracts) sales backlog was $99,606,000, $105,634,000, and $68,840,000 at March 31, 2008, March 31, 2007, and March 31, 2006, respectively.
118. Certain of the Companys contracts with the U.S. Government contain clauses permitting the government to terminate the contract for convenience upon certain terms and conditions, including partial payment to the Company for work performed. Total contracts with U.S Government agencies and subcontractors in the backlog were $42,640,000, $58,833,000, and $30,058,000, at March 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. It is estimated that approximately 77% of the 2008 backlog will be filled within the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009.
119. Most export sales are transacted in U.S. dollars, and most are either secured by irrevocable letters of credit or paid in advance. The following table shows the breakdown of net sales and contract revenues to international and domestic customers and the major regions of international activity based upon customers country of domicile. All assets are maintained within the United States with the exception of inventory depots, inventory in transit or awaiting installation and cash accounts maintained at foreign locations (approximately 4% of the Companys assets).
120. International
121. Percent of International Revenue by Major Region:
122. Middle East & Africa
123. Pacific Rim
124. The Companys principal executive offices are located at 829 Middlesex Turnpike, Billerica, MA 01821; telephone number 978-262-8700; corporate website www.as-e.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual Form 10-K, current reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as practicable. In addition, our reports, proxy and information statements and other information filed with the SEC are available at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549 (1-800-SEC-0330), and are also available from the SECs website at www.sec.gov.
125. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of the following risks occur, the Companys business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
126. The Companys business is dependent on sales to a small number of customers, which include agencies of the United States government. During fiscal 2008, two customers accounted for 22% of the Companys total revenues. During fiscal 2007, two customers accounted for 46% of the Companys total revenues, and during fiscal 2006, two customers accounted for 56% of the Companys total revenues. Certain of the Companys government contracts may be terminated at the governments discretion. The termination of the Companys relationship with one or more of its significant customers or the reduction or delay of orders of its systems by these customers would substantially reduce the Companys revenues, and its business and prospects may be harmed.
127. The Companys revenues to international customers, including foreign governments, accounted for approximately 36%, 27% and 14% of its net revenues for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2008, March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2006, respectively, and a significant number of domestic customer orders require shipments to, and services provided in, overseas locations. In addition, the
128. Company transacts business internationally with a number of its key suppliers. As a result of the Companys worldwide business operations, it is subject to various risks, including:
129. international regulatory requirements and policy changes;
130. lengthy sales cycles;
131. longer payment cycles by foreign customers;
132. difficulties in inventory management, accounts receivable collection and the management of distributors or representatives;
133. difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;
134. geopolitical instability;
135. political and economic changes and disruptions;
136. favoritism towards local suppliers;
137. governmental currency controls;
138. interruption to transportation flow for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;
139. currency exchange rate fluctuations; and
140. tariff regulations.
141. Although the Companys international sales have been denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates that increase the relative value of the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult for the Company to compete with foreign manufacturers on price or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its sales and operating results.
142. A substantial portion of the Companys sales depends upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand security at border crossing inspection sites, existing airports, seaports and other facilities. Accordingly, a portion of the Companys product sales is subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes that often accompany such capital expenditures. During these approval periods, the Company expends significant financial and managerial resources in anticipation of future orders that may not occur. If the Company fails to receive an order after expending these resources, it may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to recover the costs incurred and its business and prospects may be harmed.
143. The Companys largest customers are government agencies and demand for its products is dependent upon national priorities and governmental initiatives, including defense-related programs. These priorities and initiatives are subject to change from time to time in response to the economic and political environment. The Company is also exposed to the United States budget approval and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events and macroeconomic conditions, and are beyond our control. While the overall level of U.S. defense spending has increased in recent years for numerous reasons, including increases in funding of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and the U.S. Department of Defenses military transformation initiatives, we can give no assurance that such spending will continue to grow, or not be reduced. Significant changes in defense spending could have long-term consequences for our size and structure. In addition, changes in government priorities and requirements could impact the funding, or the timing of funding, of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
144. The Company competes in markets in which the Company or its customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as health and safety regulations. The Company develops, configures and markets its products to meet its customers needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for the Companys products or increase its costs to comply with new regulations, both of which may adversely affect its operating results.
145. The Company relies on a number of suppliers to provide material and subsystems for our products. The Company is reliant on a number of key international supply partners for core technology products, including subsystems with complex sub-tier supply chains. In addition, certain material or subsystems used in our products may be available from a sole source or limited number of suppliers, increasing the risk of supply disruption. Although our products may be able to be redesigned to avoid using any sole source supplier, it would be expensive and time consuming to make such a change. If the Company changes any of its suppliers, a qualification process would need to be completed and the affected product may require redesign, creating potential delays in product shipments.
146. Some of our suppliers may allocate material due to market demand for the products they produce or market constraints such as the global availability of raw materials. We have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and there can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet our requirements. Many of our competitors are much larger and may be able to obtain priority allocations from these shared suppliers, thereby limiting or making our sources of supply unreliable for these components. If our supply of materials is disrupted, we cannot ensure that we would be able to find another supplier on a timely basis.
147. The Company depends on its subcontractors and suppliers to deliver material that is in full compliance with critical quality and specification requirements. Quality issues may affect the reliability and performance of our products, customer confidence, and adversely impact financial performance. Any difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of conforming material could result in delays or reductions in product shipments that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and consolidated results of operations. This in turn could also damage our reputation in the market and cause us to lose market share. The Company does not expect to experience sustained difficulties in securing required material and subsystems to support forward business operations.
148. Given the nature of the markets in which the Company participates, it cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability. A high proportion of the Companys costs are fixed, due in part to its significant sales, research and development, and manufacturing costs. As a result of its fixed costs, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect the Companys operating results and stock price in a quarter. Factors that may affect the Companys quarterly operating results and the market price of its common stock include:
149. demand for and market acceptance of its X-ray inspection systems;
150. lengthy sales cycles and the effect of large orders;
151. changes in political agendas or national priorities;
152. adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which the Company does business;
153. political unrest in the regions where the Company transacts business;
154. adverse changes in industries on which the Company is particularly dependent;
155. competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices for its products;
156. delays or problems in the introduction of new products;
157. the Companys competitors announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations;
158. variations in the Companys product mix;
159. the timing and amount of the Companys expenditures in anticipation of future sales;
160. increased costs of raw materials or supplies; and
161. changes in the volume or timing of product orders.
162. If the Companys X-ray inspection systems fail to detect the presence of bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats to personal safety, the Company could be subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could result in increased costs, reduced sales, and a decline in the market price of the Companys common stock. There are many factors beyond the Companys control that could result in the failure of its products to detect the presence of bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats to personal safety. Examples of these factors include operator error or misuse of or malfunction of its equipment. The failure of the Companys systems to detect the presence of these dangerous materials may lead to personal injury, loss of life, and extensive property damage and may result in potential claims against the Company.
163. The Companys product liability and umbrella liability insurance may be insufficient to protect it from product liability claims. Moreover, there is a risk that product liability insurance will not continue to be available to the Company at a reasonable cost, if at all. If liability claims exceed the Companys current or available insurance coverage, its business and prospects may be harmed. Regardless of the adequacy of the Companys product liability insurance protection, any significant claim may have an adverse affect on its industry and market reputation, leading to a substantial decrease in demand for its products and reduced revenues.
164. The Company generates funds for its research and development activities from operations, private sources and the government. The Company may be unable to generate the funds necessary to support its research and development activities if it does not generate sufficient funds from operations, other potential private sources, or the government. The Company may not successfully compete with other companies and research institutions for government funding and funding from other private sources. Additionally, government-funding priorities are subject to frequent changes. For example, in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company recorded $13,978,000, $6,597,000 and $2,804,000, respectively, for government-sponsored research and development. There is no guarantee that the Company will receive funds for government-sponsored research in the future. If the Company is unable to fund its research and development activities through its operations or from outside sources, the Company may be unable to continue to innovate or bring its innovations to market on a timely or cost effective basis, or its innovations may be surpassed by other competitors or new technologies.
165. The Companys continuing research and development program is designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve its current products. The Company plans to expend significant resources on the development of its new products. The successful development of its products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:
166. unanticipated delays;
167. access to capital;
168. budget overruns;
169. technical problems; and
170. other difficulties that could result in the abandonment or substantial change in the design, development and commercialization of new products and product enhancements, including for example, changes requested or required by governmental and regulatory agencies.
171. Given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction of X-ray inspection systems, the Company cannot assure that its product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget, if at all. The Companys failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget would harm its business and prospects.
172. The market for the Companys products has been characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions and evolving industry standards and customer requirements. The Company believes that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future. The Companys success will depend, in part, upon its ability to enhance its existing products, successfully develop new products that meet changing customer and regulatory requirements and gain market acceptance. If the Company fails to do so, its products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology, in which case
173. its revenue and operating results would suffer. In developing any new product, the Company may be required to make a substantial investment before it can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If the Company fails to accurately foresee its customers needs and future activities, it may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue.
174. A number of companies have developed products that compete with the Companys X-ray inspection products. Many of the Companys competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than it does. Some of its competitors have more extensive research, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and greater technical and personnel resources than the Company does, and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry. The Companys failure to compete successfully could decrease demand for its products or make its products obsolete.
175. In the inspection systems market, competition is based primarily on the following factors:
176. product performance, functionality and quality;
177. the overall cost of ownership of the system;
178. prior customer relationships;
179. technological capabilities of the product;
180. certification by government authorities;
181. local market presence; and
182. breadth of the sales and service organization.
183. To remain competitive, the Company must develop new products and periodically enhance its existing products in a timely manner. The Company anticipates that it may have to adjust the prices of some of its products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors may emerge, and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines.
184. The Company relies primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, licensing arrangements and confidentiality procedures to protect its technology. Despite its precautions, the steps the Company has taken to protect its technology may be inadequate. Existing trade secret, patent, trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection. The Companys patents could be invalidated or circumvented. In addition, others may develop substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology, or competitors may offer equivalent products in competition with the Companys products, thereby substantially reducing the value of the Companys proprietary rights. The laws of some foreign countries in which the Companys products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not protect its products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. This may make the possibility of piracy of the Companys technology and products more likely. The Company cannot assure that the steps it has taken to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology. The Companys inability to protect its intellectual property could have a negative impact on its operations and financial results.
185. Initiating or defending against the enforcement of the Companys intellectual property rights may result in significant, protracted, and costly litigation. The Company has previously been involved in various litigations involving its intellectual property and has been successful in protecting such interests to date. The Company expects intellectual property disputes to be an ordinary part of its business for the foreseeable future. The Company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of its intellectual property rights, or to establish the validity of its property rights. There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in any such action. Litigation by or against the Company could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation results in a favorable outcome for the Company. In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, the Company could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, discontinue
186. the use of certain processes, or obtain licenses for the infringing technology. If a license were required, the Company cannot assure that it would be able to obtain one on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The Company cannot assure that it will be successful in developing non-infringing technology or that the cost or time required to develop such technology will be reasonable.
187. The Companys future success depends in large measure upon the continued contributions of its senior management team and other key personnel. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain key personnel or executive management in sufficient numbers, with the requisite skills or on acceptable terms necessary or advisable to support our continued growth. If we lose professionals or are unable to attract new talent, we will not be able to maintain our position in the market or grow our business.
188. The Company may require additional capital to finance continuing operations. The Company cannot assure that operations will continue to be profitable, that it will generate levels of revenues and cash flows sufficient to fund operations, or, if necessary, that the Company will be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any existing financing arrangements may not be available or sufficient to meet the Companys cash needs or may not be available in the future, or, if available, at a cost that the Company believes is reasonable.
189. Substantially all of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock are freely tradable without restriction or further registration. Affiliates must sell all shares they own in compliance with the volume and other requirements of Rule 144, except for the holding period requirements. Nevertheless, sales of substantial amounts of common stock by the Companys stockholders, or even the potential for such sales, may cause the market price of the Companys common stock to decline and could impair the Companys ability to raise capital through the sale of the Companys equity securities.
190. The market price of the Companys common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. The Company believes that a variety of factors could cause the price of the Companys common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:
191. announcements of developments related to the Companys business;
192. quarterly fluctuations in the Companys actual or anticipated operating results and order levels;
193. general conditions in the worldwide economy;
194. announcements of technological innovations;
195. new products or product enhancements by the Company or its competitors;
196. developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; and
197. developments in the Companys relationships with its customers and suppliers.
198. In addition, in recent years the stock market in general, and the markets for shares of small capitalization and high-tech companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of the Companys common stock.
199. Provisions in the Companys articles of organization and the Companys shareholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Companys common stock. Specifically, the Companys articles of organization authorize its Board of Directors to issue up to 100,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to fix certain rights, preferences, privileges and
200. restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued shares of preferred stock, to fix the number of shares constituting any such series, and to fix the designation of any such series, without further vote or action by its shareholders. The terms of any series of preferred stock, which may include priority claims to assets and dividends and special voting rights, could adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock and thereby reduce the value of the Companys common stock. The Company has no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock. The Company has in place a shareholder rights plan, which was renewed in April of 2008, under which its stockholders are entitled to purchase shares of its preferred stock under certain circumstances. These circumstances include the purchase of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock by a person or group, or the announcement of a tender or exchange offer to acquire 15% or more of the outstanding common stock. The shareholder rights plan may have the effect of impeding or preventing certain types of transactions involving a change in control of the Company that could be beneficial to the stockholders.

52. Transmission X-ray Technology:Transmission images are created from X-rays that pass through the object that is being examined. Medical X-ray images are a type of transmission X-ray. In transmission imaging, the detector measures the relative intensity of the X-rays that pass directly through the object. The degree to which X-rays are transmitted through an object is dependant upon the size of the X-ray source and the composition and quantity of the material in the path of the X-ray beam. Low energy sources are used to scan smaller objects such as parcels and baggage, and high energy sources are used for scanning large items such as trucks and cargo containers. Transmission X-ray images are useful for seeing through the object of interest. A transmission image, however, represents an aggregate of all objects in the path on the beam and can therefore be difficult to interpret.
53. Z Backscatter Technology:Many of the Companys X-ray systems utilize AS&Es patented Z Backscatter technology. The term Backscatter refers to those X-rays thatscatteroff of the object under examinationbacktoward the X-ray source. Z Backscatter detectors capture these scattered X-rays which are then used to create highly readable, photo-like images.
54. OtherTechnologies:Two other technologies employed by AS&E are Shaped Energy and Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD). Shaped Energy technology is a specialized form of high energy transmission X-ray which is used in AS&Es OmniView product line. Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD) is a technology which is used to find radioactive materials in vehicles.
55. CargoSearch Inspection Systems:The CargoSearch family of systems includes non-intrusive inspection products which are primarily used for the screening of trucks, cars, cargo containers, pallets, and air cargo. These systems are used at locations including border crossings, seaports, military bases, railroad centers, airports, and cargo and transportation hubs. The CargoSearch systems are designed to combat trade fraud, drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, and terrorism. The CargoSearch family includes:
56. Z Backscatter Systems:Z Backscatter Systems include imaging systems that use Z Backscatter imaging only.
57. ParcelSearch Inspection Systems:ParcelSearch systems are designed for the non-intrusive X-ray scanning of parcels, baggage, and mail. They are primarily located in government facilities, airports, commercial office buildings, high-security federal facilities and convention centers. The ParcelSearch family includes:
58. Personnel Screening:Personnel screening is a crucial part of any threat detection effort. Today, threats can take the smallest of forms and are often easily hidden on a person. With the advent of suicide bombings, personnel screening has taken on an even more important role. Personnel screening is also important in the effort to intercept prohibited substances, such as drugs and alcohol.
59. Contract Research & Development:AS&E engages in a variety of contract research and development (CRAD) programs, mostly for agencies of the US government. AS&E pursues CRAD opportunities which it believes provide avenues for advancing our core technologies or developing product offerings for strategic customers or markets. One such important program is the CAARS (Cargo Advanced Radiography System) program for DHS Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO). CAARS is a program under which AS&E is developing advanced detection technology for inspecting cargo containers for nuclear materials.
60. Service and Support:AS&Es Field Service Engineers (FSEs) provide support services on most of AS&Es X-ray inspection systems worldwide. FSEs are located at AS&E offices in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America. In addition, Technical Support is provided at the Companys headquarters in Billerica, Massachusetts. AS&E provides comprehensive, cost-effective spare parts solutions customized for each system. The Company maintains an inventory of field-replaceable components in order to meet customer needs for spare parts.
61. American Science and Engineering, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation formed in 1958 (together with its subsidiary, the Company or AS&E), develops, manufactures, markets, and sells X-ray inspection and other inspection solutions for homeland security and other targeted markets. AS&E provides maintenance, warranty, research, engineering, and training services related to these solutions.
62. The Company manufactures a range of sophisticated X-ray inspection products that can be used to inspect parcels, baggage, vehicles, pallets, cargo containers, and people. The Company sells its products in the U.S. and throughout the world to a variety of customers, including:
63. AS&Es products are used by these customers to help combat terrorism, trade fraud, drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, and illegal immigration. Our products are also used for military force protection and general facility security.
64. Beginning with the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and continuing with the proliferation of global terrorism, homeland security and force protection concerns have become of paramount importance in the United States and around the world. The Company believes that homeland defense, force protection and military security initiatives will continue to provide new revenue opportunities, with additional growth in the seaports and borders, federal and military facilities, and corporate security markets.
65. The Companys objective is to distinguish itself from its competitors by offering innovative products which provide superior threat detection. To achieve this, AS&E incorporates a variety of X-ray imaging and image processing technologies into its products. A number of the Companys products use our patented Z Backscatter technology. Z Backscatter is a unique X-ray imaging technique that has distinct advantages for the detection of organic, or low atomic number (Z) materials such as plastic explosives, composite weapons, and illegal drugs even when concealed by complex backgrounds.
66. The Companys X-ray imaging products utilize several technologies including traditional transmission X-ray technology, our proprietary Z Backscatter technology, Shaped Energy technology and Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD).
67. X-ray imaging devices contain these basic subsystems: X-ray sources, detectors, and software. The source generates an X-ray beam that is directed at the object to be scanned (baggage, container, etc.). When the source X-rays encounter the object, they are either absorbed by the object, pass directly through the object, or scatter off of the object. Dense (high atomic number) materials tend to absorb X-rays. Materials that are less dense (low atomic number) tend to scatter X-rays. The detectors record the intensity of the transmitted or scattered X-rays. Software is then used to interpret the signals from the detectors and to construct and display X-ray images.
68. Many threats items are organic in nature and have low atomic numbers. Such items include drugs, explosives, composite weapons, and stowaways. These items tend to scatter X-rays much more so than inorganic materials like steel and other metals. As a result, these organic threat items tend to stand out as bright, visible objects when scanned by a Z Backscatter imaging system.
69. Z Backscatter images complement transmission images and several of the Companys products employ both technologies. The combination of backscatter and transmission images gives security officials more information about the contents of the baggage or container by differentiating dense materials, such as metals, from low-Z materials such as explosives. In addition, the two images enable an inspector to perform a quicker and more thorough examination of the object in question.

71. AS&E also employs several other X-ray imaging and image processing technologies which are described below.
72. The Companys products and services can be grouped into six different areas including CargoSearch Inspection Systems, Z Backscatter Systems, ParcelSearch Inspection Systems, Personnel Inspection, Contract Research and Development, and Service and Support.
73. Gemini is a parcel and baggage inspection system which combines AS&Es Z Backscatter technology with Dual-energy transmission X-ray to provide enhanced detection for a wide range of threats. Dual-energy transmission is best suited for the detection of traditional threats such as guns and knives, and for identifying wires and other components of IEDs. It also provides some organic and metallic discrimination in uncluttered environments. Z Backscatter imaging provides enhanced detection of organic materials such as explosives and narcotics, which may be missed by transmission-only systems in cluttered baggage. In addition, the complementary photo-like Z Backscatter image makes it easier for security officers to interpret images, thus reducing analysis time and minimizing operator fatigue.

77. The Company relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, contract and trade secret laws to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its technology. The Company has patents either issued and/or pending in the United States, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, China, Austria, France, Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Israel, The
78. Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Mexico, Norway, The Russian Federation, Ukraine, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Thailand and Egypt, and under the Gulf Cooperation Council and the Patent Cooperation Treaty.
79. In general, the Company pursues a policy of obtaining patent protection both in the United States and in selected foreign countries for subject matter we consider patentable and important to our business strategy. The Company has 54 unexpired patents issued by, and 63 patent applications pending with, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as with the respective patent offices of the foreign countries noted above. Over half of our issued patents have been issued in the last five years.
80. Generally, patents issued in the United States are effective for the longer of 17 years from the date of issue or 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the corresponding patent application if filed prior to June 8, 1995. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with applicable local law. While the duration of our patents varies, we believe that the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.
81. The Company believes that its patents, proprietary technology, know-how, and trademarks provide substantial protection for the Companys competitive position and the Company intends to aggressively protect its intellectual property assets, by litigation or other means, as appropriate. Nevertheless, there can be no assurances that the steps taken by the Company in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or infringement of its technology or that the Companys competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the Companys technology. Effective protection of intellectual property rights may be limited or unavailable in certain foreign countries. See Item 3: Legal Proceedings below.
82. The Companys X-ray products are marketed to private and governmental organizations through a sales force that contacts potential customers and responds to public tenders and other expressions of interest. This sales force includes Company personnel based in the United States and abroad, as well as independent representatives under contracts to sell in foreign countries.
83. The Company has a customer base consisting of government and commercial clients from both the United States and abroad. Domestically, the Companys primary client base is comprised of agencies of the U.S. Government. Approximately 70%, 77%, and 75% of the Companys sales in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were derived from either (i) contracting directly with the U.S. Government, or (ii) contracting with contractors working directly with the U.S. Government. Certain of the Companys contracts with the U.S. Government provide the U.S. Government with the standard unilateral right to terminate these contracts for convenience. To date, the Company has not experienced any material losses as a result of this contractual provision. The Company is heavily dependent upon sales to agencies of the U.S. Government and reductions or delays in procurement of the Companys systems by these agencies may have a material adverse effect on the Company.
84. International sales, primarily to foreign governments, accounted for approximately 27%, 14% and 15%, of the Companys total sales in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and continue to be a high priority for the Company as part of its long-term growth strategy. International sales entail longer sales cycles and project financing requirements; however the Company continues to focus on these sales as a means of broadening its customer base and reducing its dependency on sales to the U.S. Government. The Company manages its overseas risk in a number of ways, including actively increasing the number of opportunities it is pursuing at any one time, working with international funding sources to help customers finance and secure funding of these projects, and obtaining downpayments and letters of credit to secure its international receivables. The majority of international contracts are bid in U.S. dollars. For those contracts that are bid in other currencies, the Company considers the need to engage in hedging contracts to control foreign exchange risk. There were no hedging activities in fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005.
85. In fiscal 2007, the Company had sales to two major customers, both agencies of the U.S. Government, which accounted for 31% and 15% of total sales. In fiscal 2006, these same customers accounted for 26% and 30% of total sales. In fiscal 2005, the Company had sales to three major customers, two of which were agencies of the U.S. Government and the third a subcontractor to a U.S. Government agency, which accounted for 17%, 13%, and 13% of total sales.
86. The Company has many competitors in the homeland security X-ray detection market, including several large and well-established manufacturers of security equipment with financial and other resources greater than those of the Company. Certain X-ray security system customers select such systems based largely on price. Other customers, including some agencies of the U.S. Government and certain users in countries with high levels of concern over security, tend to select systems based largely on detection capability. Many of the Companys systems offer premium performance and have in some cases been priced higher than many competing systems. The Company believes that its patented and proprietary technology give it a strong competitive position in the sale of security systems to customers concerned with performance and detection. The Company also believes that its strategy
87. of concentrating on products with unique features, including Z Backscatter and Shaped Energy, and/or competitive pricing will give it a strong position to increase its sales of X-ray systems. However, a number of companies have developed products that compete with the Companys X-ray inspection products. (See Forward-Looking Information and Factors Affecting Future Performance)
88. In August 2006, the Companys Quality Management System was recertified under the ISO 9001:2000 Standard of the International Organization for Standardization which it has been registered under since 2003. ISO 9001 is an internationally recognized quality management and assurance standard.
89. In qualifying, the Company met or exceeded the standards for establishing a quality management system for preventing non-conformity at every level of the product life cycle, from customer order, through development and production, to installation and support.
90. The Company believes that demonstrating continuous quality improvement is vital for building customer satisfaction and making business processes more efficient in order to increase its competitive edge.
91. The Company has not experienced during the last year, and does not currently anticipate, any product delivery delays due to component shortages. The majority of procured components are from U.S. sources. However, the Company is dependent upon certain overseas providers of important components. No rare or exotic materials are utilized. Following the events of September 11, 2001, demand for X-ray system subcomponents increased significantly across the security industry. In response, the Company took steps to mitigate sourcing risks by working closely with its vendors to secure future component availability. In some cases, the Company has chosen to stock certain inventory components to assure future availability. These efforts also included identifying and qualifying second-source providers for a number of critical components of its product lines.
92. AS&E complies with applicable federal regulations under Title 21 CFR Subchapter J - Radiological Health. All AS&E cabinet X-ray products comply with all applicable U.S. Government radiation safety performance standards including 21 CFR 1020.40. All personnel inspection systems of AS&E comply with the voluntary consensus radiation safety standards adopted by the American National Standards Institute ANSI N43.17-2002.
93. The Company spent approximately $7,184,000 of its own funds for research and development during fiscal 2007, compared to $9,601,000 and $5,727,000 in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. The fiscal 2007 research and development efforts were focused on design modifications and enhancements to existing products, the development of new applications and the development of new products.
94. In addition, the Company conducted government-sponsored research primarily focused on advances in X-ray systems, image analysis and integrated system development for niche security inspection problems. The Company recognized revenues of $6,597,000, $2,804,000, and $2,534,000 in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively for these efforts. A significant amount of the Companys government sponsored research and development contracts provide for a fixed fee or a reimbursement of allowable costs plus a fixed fee. The Companys contracts in these areas are obtained by submitting research and development proposals to various organizations, sometimes in response to requests for such proposals.
95. As of March 31, 2007 the Company had 299 employees as compared to 288 employees at March 31, 2006. It is the Companys policy to have employees sign nondisclosure agreements as a condition of employment. None of the Companys employees are represented by labor unions.
96. The Companys firm (under signed contracts) sales backlog was $105,634,000, $68,840,000, and $72,098,000 at March 31, 2007, March 31, 2006, and March 31, 2005, respectively.
97. Certain of the Companys contracts with the U.S. Government contain clauses permitting the government to terminate the contract for convenience upon certain terms and conditions, including partial payment to the Company for work performed. Total contracts with U.S Government agencies and subcontractors in the backlog were $58,833,000, $30,058,000, and $48,127,000, at March 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. It is estimated that approximately 86% of the 2007 backlog will be filled within the fiscal year ending March 31, 2008.
98. Most export sales are transacted in U.S. dollars, and many are either secured by irrevocable letters of credit or paid in advance. The following table shows the breakdown of net sales and contract revenues to international and domestic customers and the major regions of international activity based upon customers country of domicile. All assets are maintained within the United States with the exception of small amounts of spares inventory and cash accounts maintained at foreign locations (approximately 1% of the Companys assets).

102. The Companys principal executive offices are located at 829 Middlesex Turnpike, Billerica, MA 01821; telephone number 978-262-8700; corporate website www.as-e.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our annual Form 10-K, current reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as practicable. In addition, our reports, proxy and information statements and other information filed with the SEC are available at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Room 1580, Washington, DC 20549 (1-800-SEC-0330), and are also available from the SECs website at www.sec.gov.
103. The Companys business is heavily dependent on sales to a small number of customers, which include agencies of the United States government. During fiscal 2007, two customers accounted for 46% of the Companys total revenues. During fiscal 2006, two customers accounted for 56% of the Companys total revenues and during fiscal 2005, three customers accounted for 43% of the Companys total revenues. Certain of the Companys government contracts may be terminated at the governments discretion. The termination of the Companys relationship with one or more of its significant customers or the reduction or delay of orders of its systems by these customers would substantially reduce the Companys revenues, and its business and prospects may be harmed.
104. The Companys revenues to international customers, including foreign governments, accounted for approximately 27%, 14% and 15% of its net revenues for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2007, March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005, respectively, and a significant number of domestic customer orders require shipments to, and services provided in, overseas locations. In addition, the Company transacts business internationally with a number of its key suppliers. As a result of the Companys worldwide business operations, it is subject to various risks, including:
105. Although the Companys international sales have been denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates that increase the relative value of the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult for the Company to compete with foreign manufacturers on price or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its sales and operating results.
106. A substantial portion of the Companys sales depends upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand security at border crossing inspection sites, existing airports, seaports and other facilities. Accordingly, a portion of the Companys product sales is subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes that often accompany such capital expenditures. During these approval periods, the Company expends significant financial and managerial resources in anticipation of future orders that may not occur. If the Company fails to receive an order after expending these resources, it may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to recover the costs incurred and its business and prospects may be harmed.
107. The Companys largest customers are government agencies and demand for its products is dependent upon national priorities and governmental initiatives. These priorities and initiatives are subject to change from time to time in response to the economic and political environment. The Company is also exposed to the United States budget approval and appropriation cycle, which may be subject to significant and unpredictable delays. If demand for the Companys products is reduced because of a change in economic or political conditions, or if there are delays in receiving governmental approvals and appropriations, sales of the Companys products may be adversely affected, and its business and prospects may be harmed.
108. The Company competes in markets in which the Company or its customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as health and safety regulations. The Company develops, configures and markets its products to meet its customers needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for the Companys products or increase its costs to comply with new regulations, both of which may adversely affect its operating results.
109. The Company relies on only a limited number of suppliers for some key components for its products. The Companys reliance on limited supply sources reduces its control over timely delivery, price increases, reliability, and quality of critical components. Obtaining alternative sources of supply of these key components could involve significant delays and other costs, and may not be
110. available to the Company on reasonable terms, if at all. If the Company changes any of its suppliers, the potential new supplier would be required to go through a qualification process, creating potential delays or reductions in product shipments. The failure of any supplier to provide quality and timely components at an acceptable price, or an interruption of supplies from such a supplier could result in lost or deferred sales, which would harm the Companys business and prospects.
111. Given the nature of the markets in which the Company participates, it cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability. A high proportion of the Companys costs are fixed, due in part to its significant sales, research and development, and manufacturing costs. As a result of its fixed costs, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect the Companys operating results and stock price in a quarter. Factors that may affect the Companys quarterly operating results and the market price of its common stock include:
112. If the Companys X-ray inspection systems fail to detect the presence of bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats to personal safety, the Company could be subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could result in increased costs, reduced sales, and a decline in the market price of the Companys common stock. There are many factors beyond the Companys control that could result in the failure of its products to detect the presence of bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats to personal safety. Examples of these factors include operator error or misuse of or malfunction of its equipment. The failure of the Companys systems to detect the presence of these dangerous materials may lead to personal injury, loss of life, and extensive property damage and may result in potential claims against the Company.
113. The Companys product liability and umbrella liability insurance may be insufficient to protect it from product liability claims. Moreover, there is a risk that product liability insurance will not continue to be available to the Company at a reasonable cost, if at all. If liability claims exceed the Companys current or available insurance coverage, its business and prospects may be harmed. Regardless of the adequacy of the Companys product liability insurance protection, any significant claim may have an adverse affect on its industry and market reputation, leading to a substantial decrease in demand for its products and reduced revenues.
114. The Company generates funds for its research and development activities from operations, private sources and the government. The Company may be unable to generate the funds necessary to support its research and development activities if it does not generate sufficient funds from operations, other potential private sources, or the government. The Company may not successfully compete with other companies and research institutions for government funding and funding from other private sources. Additionally, government-funding priorities are subject to frequent changes. For example, in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded $6,597,000, $2,804,000 and $2,534,000, respectively, for government-sponsored research and development. There is no guarantee that the Company will receive funds for government-sponsored research in the future. If the Company is unable to fund its research and development activities through its operations or from outside sources, the Company may be unable to continue to innovate or bring its innovations to market on a timely or cost effective basis, or its innovations may be surpassed by other competitors or new technologies.
115. The Companys continuing research and development program is designed to develop new products and to enhance and improve its current products. The Company plans to expend significant resources on the development of its new products. The successful development of its products and product enhancements is subject to numerous risks, both known and unknown, including:
116. Given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction of X-ray inspection systems, the Company cannot assure that its product development efforts will be successful on a timely basis or within budget, if at all. The Companys failure to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely basis or within budget would harm its business and prospects.
117. The market for the Companys products has been characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions and evolving industry standards and customer requirements. The Company believes that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future. The Companys success will depend, in part, upon its ability to enhance its existing products,successfully
118. The market for the Companys products has been characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions and evolving industry standards and customer requirements. The Company believes that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future. The Companys success will depend, in part, upon its ability to enhance its existing products,
119. A number of companies have developed products that compete with the Companys X-ray inspection products. Many of the Companys competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than it does. Some of its competitors have more extensive research, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and greater technical and personnel resources than the Company does, and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry. The Companys failure to compete successfully could decrease demand for its products or make its products obsolete.
120. In the inspection systems market, competition is based primarily on the following factors:
121. To remain competitive, the Company must develop new products and periodically enhance its existing products in a timely manner. The Company anticipates that it may have to adjust the prices of some of its products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors may emerge, and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines.
122. The Company relies primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, licensing arrangements and confidentiality procedures to protect its technology. Despite its precautions, the steps the Company has taken to protect its technology may be inadequate. Existing trade secret, patent, trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection. The Companys patents could be invalidated or circumvented. The laws of some foreign countries in which the Companys products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not protect its products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. This may make the possibility of piracy of the Companys technology and products more likely. The Company cannot assure that the steps it has taken to protect its intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology. The Companys business could be harmed if it is unable to protect its intellectual property.
123. Initiating or defending against the enforcement of the Companys intellectual property rights may result in significant, protracted, and costly litigation. The Company has previously been involved in various litigations involving its intellectual property and has been successful in protecting such interests to date. The Company expects intellectual property disputes to be an ordinary part of its business for the foreseeable future. The Company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of its intellectual property rights, or to establish the validity of its property rights. There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in any such action. Litigation by or against the Company could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation results in a favorable outcome for the Company. In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, the Company could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, discontinue the use of certain processes, or obtain licenses for the infringing technology. If a license were required, the Company cannot assure that it would be able to obtain one on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The Company cannot assure that it will be successful in developing non-infringing technology or that the cost or time required to develop such technology will be reasonable.
124. During fiscal 2004, the CEO and certain other members of our senior management team left the Company. The Company subsequently recruited what it believes to be a highly qualified team of executives to join the Company. The Companys future success will continue to depend in large measure upon the continued contributions of its senior management team and other key personnel. If we lose professionals or are unable to attract new talent, we will not be able to maintain our position in the market or grow our business.
125. Substantially all of the Companys outstanding shares of common stock are freely tradable without restriction or further registration. Affiliates must sell all shares they own in compliance with the volume and other requirements of Rule 144, except for the holding period requirements. Nevertheless, sales of substantial amounts of common stock by the Companys stockholders, or even the potential for such sales, may cause the market price of the Companys common stock to decline and could impair the Companys ability to raise capital through the sale of the Companys equity securities.
126. The Company may require additional capital to finance continuing operations. The Company cannot assure that operations will continue to be profitable, that it will generate levels of revenues and cash flows sufficient to fund operations, or, if necessary, that the Company will be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any existing financing arrangements may not be available or sufficient to meet the Companys cash needs or may not be available in the future, or, if available, at a cost that the Company believes is reasonable.
127. The market price of the Companys common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. The Company believes that a variety of factors could cause the price of the Companys common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:
128. In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of small capitalization and high-tech companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of the Companys common stock.
129. Provisions in the Companys articles of organization and the Companys shareholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a change in control. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Companys common stock. Specifically, the Companys articles of organization authorize its Board of Directors to issue up to 100,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to fix certain rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued shares of preferred stock, to fix the number of shares constituting any such series, and to fix the designation of any such series, without further vote or action by its shareholders. The terms of any series of preferred stock, which may include priority claims to assets and dividends and special voting rights, could adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock and thereby reduce the value of the Companys common stock. The Company has no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock. The Company has in place a shareholder rights plan, adopted in 1998, under which its stockholders are entitled to purchase shares of its preferred stock under certain circumstances. These circumstances include the purchase of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock by a person or group, or the announcement of a tender or exchange offer to acquire 15% or more of the outstanding common stock. The shareholder rights plan may have the effect of impeding or preventing certain types of transactions involving a change in control of the Company that could be beneficial to the stockholders.
