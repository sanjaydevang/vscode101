4962,2011,2011-02-28,12/31/2010,The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 will significantly impact our business practices and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

4962,2010,2010-02-26,12/31/2009,"Banks, card issuers and card network operators generally are the subject of increasing global regulatory focus, which may impose costly new compliance burdens on our Company and lead to decreased transaction volumes and revenues through our network."
4962,2010,2010-02-26,12/31/2009,"If we are not able to protect our intellectual property, and invest successfully in, and compete at the leading edge of, technological developments across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected."
4962,2010,2010-02-26,12/31/2009,Regulation in the areas of privacy and data security could increase our costs and decrease the number of charge and credit cards issued.

4962,2010,2010-02-26,12/31/2009,Our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry.
4962,2010,2010-02-26,12/31/2009,We face increasingly intense competitive pressure that may impact the prices we charge merchants who accept our Cards for payment for goods and services.
4962,2010,2010-02-26,12/31/2009,"We may not be successful in our efforts to promote Card usage through our marketing, promotion and rewards programs or to effectively control the costs of such programs, both of which may impact our profitability."
4962,2010,2010-02-26,12/31/2009,"Our brand and reputation are key assets of our Company, and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace."
4962,2010,2010-02-26,12/31/2009,An increase in account data breaches and fraudulent activity using our Cards could lead to reputational damage to our brand and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit Cards.

4962,2010,2010-02-26,12/31/2009,An inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.
4962,2010,2010-02-26,12/31/2009,"If our global network systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactions efficiently or at all, our revenue and profitability would be materially reduced."
4962,2010,2010-02-26,12/31/2009,We rely on third-party providers of various computer systems and other services integral to the operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could harm our business.
