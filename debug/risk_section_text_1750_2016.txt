  PART I     
 
    ITEM 1.    BUSINESS  (Dollars in millions)     




General  
        AAR CORP. and its subsidiaries are referred to herein collectively as "AAR," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" unless the context
indicates otherwise. AAR was founded in 1951, organized in 1955 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1966. We are a diversified provider of products and services to the worldwide aviation and government
and defense markets. 
        During
fiscal 2015, we executed on a comprehensive strategic plan that included:


• The sale of our Telair Cargo Group for cash of $714 million, resulting in pre-tax gains of $198.6 million in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2015 (and $27.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from the receipt of contingent consideration); 
• A decision to divest our Precision Systems Manufacturing business; 
• The exit of certain product lines and inventories in our aviation services businesses that were underperforming or not part of our
strategy going forward; 
• The reduction of our total debt by $480 million; 
• The return of capital to shareholders through $151.5 million in common stock repurchases and $12.5 million of dividends. 

        The
divestiture of these manufacturing businesses allowed us to narrow our strategy to focus on our best in class aviation and expeditionary services. In fiscal 2016, our Aviation
Services segment succeeded in expanding existing customer relationships in distribution and securing new program work with multiple international carriers. In our Expeditionary Services segment, we
have completed the successful start-up of our new contract with the U.K. Ministry of Defense providing search and rescue services in the Falkland Islands. 
        As
we enter fiscal 2017, we remain in a strong financial position to further execute on our strategy as a best in class aviation and expeditionary services company. Our cash on hand plus
unused capacity on our Revolving Credit Facility was $409 million at May 31, 2016. We expect to invest opportunistically in expanding our comprehensive suite of services to the global
commercial aviation and government and defense markets. 




Business Segments  




Aviation Services  
        The Aviation Services segment provides aftermarket support and services for the commercial aviation and government and defense markets
and accounted for 86%, 83%, and 72% of our sales in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In this segment, we also provide inventory management and distribution services, maintenance, repair and
overhaul ("MRO") and engineering services. Business activities in this segment are primarily conducted through AAR Supply Chain, Inc. (formerly known as AAR Parts Trading, Inc.); AAR
Aircraft & Engine Sales & Leasing, Inc.; AAR
Aircraft Services, Inc.; AAR Allen Services, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAR Parts Trading, Inc.); AAR Landing Gear LLC; and AAR International, Inc. 
        We
sell and lease a wide variety of new, overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components to our commercial aviation and government/defense customers. 
2



 
Table of Contents
        We
provide customized inventory supply and management, warranty claim management, and outsourcing programs for engine and airframe parts and components in support of our airline and
government customers' maintenance activities. The types of services provided under these programs include material planning, sourcing, logistics, information and program management, and parts and
component repair and overhaul. We are also an authorized distributor for more than 60 leading aviation product manufacturers. 
        We
also provide customized performance-based supply chain logistics programs in support of the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") and foreign governments. The types of services provided
under these programs include material planning, sourcing, logistics, information and program management, airframe maintenance and maintenance planning, and component repair and overhaul. 
        We
provide major airframe inspection, maintenance, repair and overhaul, painting services, line maintenance, airframe modifications, structural repairs, avionic service and installation,
exterior and interior refurbishment, and engineering services and support for many types of commercial and military aircraft. We also repair and overhaul landing gears, wheels, and brakes for
commercial and military aircraft. 
        We
operate five airframe maintenance facilities and one landing gear overhaul facility. Our landing gear overhaul facility is in Miami, Florida, where we repair and overhaul landing
gear, wheels, brakes, and actuators for different types of commercial and military aircraft. Our airframe maintenance facilities are in Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Duluth,
Minnesota; Miami, Florida; and Lake Charles, Louisiana. In fiscal 2016, we closed a regional aircraft maintenance facility in Hot Springs, Arkansas. 
        Activities
in our Aviation Services segment also include the sale and lease of used commercial aircraft. Each sale or lease is negotiated as a separate agreement that includes term,
price, representations, warranties, and lease return provisions. During fiscal 2015, we sold our last two remaining
wholly-owned aircraft and one aircraft owned with joint venture partners. At May 31, 2016, our remaining portfolio consisted of three aircraft owned through joint ventures. 
        The
majority of our sales are made pursuant to standard commercial purchase orders. U.S. government sales are generally made under standard types of government contracts, including
definite contracts which call for the performance of specified services or the delivery of specified products and ID/IQ (i.e., indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity) contracts. Certain
inventory supply and management and performance-based logistics program agreements reflect negotiated terms and conditions. 
        To
support activities within the Aviation Services segment, we acquire aviation parts and components from domestic and foreign airlines, independent aviation service companies, aircraft
leasing companies, and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM"s). We have ongoing arrangements with OEMs that provide us access to parts, repair manuals, and service bulletins in support of
parts manufactured by them. Although the terms of each arrangement vary, they typically are made on standard OEM terms as to duration, price, and delivery. From time to time, we purchase engines for
disassembly into individual parts and components. These engines may be leased to airlines on a short-term basis prior to disassembly. 




Expeditionary Services  
        The Expeditionary Services segment consists of businesses that provide products and services supporting the movement of equipment and
personnel by the DoD, foreign governments and non-governmental organizations. The Expeditionary Services segment accounted for 14%, 17%, and 28% of our sales in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014,
respectively. Business activities in this segment are primarily conducted through AAR Airlift Group, Inc.; AAR Manufacturing, Inc. and Brown International Corporation (a wholly-owned
subsidiary of AAR Manufacturing, Inc.). 
        We
provide expeditionary airlift services to the United States and other government customers. Our expeditionary airlift services provide fixed- and rotary-wing flight operations. These
operations include 
3



 
Table of Contents
search
and rescue operations and transporting personnel and cargo principally in support of the DoD. We operate and maintain a fleet of special mission customized fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft,
principally in Afghanistan, Falkland Islands, Northern Africa, and Western Pacific regions. We hold
FAR Part 133 and 135 certificates to operate aircraft and a FAR Part 145 certificate to operate a repair station. We are also Commercial Airlift Review Board certified with the DoD. 
        We
design, manufacture, and repair transportation pallets, and a wide variety of containers and shelters used in support of military and humanitarian tactical deployment activities. The
containers and shelters are used in numerous mission requirements, including armories, supply and parts storage, refrigeration systems, tactical operation centers, briefing rooms, laundry and kitchen
facilities, water treatment, and sleeping quarters. Shelters include both stationary and vehicle-mounted applications. 
        We
also provide engineering, design, and system integration services for specialized command and control systems. 
        Sales
in this segment are made to customers pursuant to standard commercial purchase orders and contracts. U.S. government sales are generally made under standard types of government
contracts, including definite contracts which call for the performance of specified services or the delivery of specified products and ID/IQ (i.e., indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity)
contracts. The majority of our products and services are procured via definite contracts. We purchase raw materials for this segment, including steel, aluminum, extrusions, and other necessary
supplies from several vendors. 




Raw Materials  
        Although we generated 54% of our fiscal 2016 sales from the sale of products, our businesses are generally engaged in limited
manufacturing activities and have minimal exposure to fluctuations in both the availability and pricing for raw materials. Where necessary, we have been able to obtain raw materials and other
inventory items from numerous sources for each segment at competitive prices, terms, and conditions, and we expect to be able to continue to do so. 




Terms of Sale  
        We generally sell our products and services under standard 30-day payment terms. On occasion, certain customers, principally foreign
customers, will negotiate extended payment terms of 60-90 days. Except for customary warranty provisions, customers neither have the right to return products nor do they have the right to
extended financing. Our contracts with the DoD and its contractors and other governmental agencies are typically firm agreements to provide products
and services at a fixed price or on a time and material basis, and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of the
government customer. 




Customers  
        The principal customers for our products and services in the Aviation Services segment are domestic and foreign commercial airlines,
domestic and foreign freight airlines, regional and commuter airlines, business and general aviation operators, OEMs, aircraft leasing companies, aftermarket aviation support companies, the DoD and
its contractors, and foreign military organizations or governments. In the Expeditionary Services segment, our principal customers include the DoD and its contractors and foreign governmental and
defense organizations. 
        Sales
of aviation products and services to our commercial airline customers are generally affected by such factors as the number, type and average age of aircraft in service, the levels
of aircraft utilization (e.g., frequency of schedules), the number of airline operators, the general economy, and the level of sales of new and used aircraft. Sales to the DoD and other
government agencies are subject to a number of 
4



 
Table of Contents
factors,
including the level of troop deployment worldwide, government funding, competitive bidding, and requirements generated by worldwide geopolitical events. 
        We
primarily market and sell products and services through our own employees. In certain markets outside of the United States, we rely on foreign sales representatives to assist in the
sale of our products and services. 




Sales to Government and Defense Customers  
        Sales to global government and defense customers (including sales to branches, agencies, and departments of the U.S. government) were
$642.6 million (38.7% of consolidated sales), $589.8 million (37.0% of consolidated sales) and $777.5 million (45.4% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. Sales to branches, agencies, and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $513.8 million (30.9% of consolidated sales), $493.1 million (30.9% of
consolidated sales), and $661.7 million (38.7% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Sales to government and defense customers are reported in each of our
reportable segments (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Since such sales are subject to competitive bidding and government funding, no assurance can be given that such
sales will continue at levels previously experienced. The majority of our U.S. government contracts are for products and services supporting the DoD logistics and mobility strategy, as well as for
expeditionary airlift services. Thus, our government contracts have changed, and may continue to change, with fluctuations in defense and other governmental agency spending. Our government contracts
are also subject to termination by the customer; in the event of such a termination we would be entitled to recover all allowable costs incurred by us through the date of termination. 




Government Regulation and Certificates  
        The Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") regulates the manufacture, repair, distribution, and operation of all aircraft and aircraft
parts operated in the United States. Similar rules and regulatory authorities exist in other countries. The inspection, maintenance and repair procedures for the various types of aircraft and
equipment are prescribed by these regulatory authorities and can be performed only by certified repair facilities utilizing certified technicians. The FAA requires that various maintenance routines be
performed on aircraft engines, certain engine parts, and airframes at regular intervals based on take off and landing cycles or flight time. Our businesses which sell defense products and services
directly to the U.S. government or through its contractors can be subject to various laws and regulations governing pricing and other factors. 
        We
have 12 FAA certificated repair stations in the United States and Europe. Of the 12 certificated FAA repair stations, seven are also European Aviation Safety Agency ("EASA")
certificated repair stations. Such certificates, which are ongoing in duration, are required for us to perform authorized maintenance, repair and overhaul services for our customers and are subject to
revocation by the government for non-compliance with applicable regulations. Of the 12 FAA certificated repair stations, 11 are in the Aviation Services segment and one is in the Expeditionary
Services segment. The seven EASA certificated repair stations are in the Aviation Services segment. We also hold FAR Part 133 and 135 certificates to operate aircraft in our
Expeditionary Services segment. We are also Commercial Airlift Review Board certified with the DoD. We believe that we possess all licenses and certifications that are material to the conduct of our
business. 




Competition  
        Competition in each of our markets is based on quality, ability to provide a broad range of products and services, speed of delivery,
and price. Competitors in our Aviation Services segment include OEMs, the service divisions of large commercial airlines, and other independent suppliers of parts, repair, and 
5



 
Table of Contents
overhaul
services to the commercial and defense markets. Our Expeditionary Services segment competes with domestic and foreign contracting companies and a number of divisions of large corporations and
other large and small companies. Although certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, we believe that we have maintained a satisfactory competitive
position through our responsiveness to customer needs, our attention to quality, and our unique combination of market expertise and technical and financial capabilities. 




Backlog  
        Backlog represents the amount of revenue that we expect to derive from unshipped orders or signed contracts. At May 31, 2016,
backlog was approximately $953.9 million compared to $920.3 million at May 31, 2015. Approximately $506.7 million of our May 31, 2016 backlog is expected to be
filled within the next 12 months. 




Employees  
        At May 31, 2016, we employed approximately 4,700 employees worldwide, of which approximately 110 employees are subject to
a collective bargaining agreement. We also retain approximately 830 contract workers, the majority of whom are located at our airframe maintenance facilities.

Table of Contents 
 
    ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS     
        The following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business. 




We are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.  
        As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of
that industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high fuel and oil prices, lack of capital, and weak
economic conditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the global
financial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limited
their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. 
        A
reduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected.
Further, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additional
airline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight
credit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. 
        Our
business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including the
following:


• deterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers; 
• reductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;  
• retirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;  
• reductions in demand for used aircraft and engines; 
• increased in-house maintenance by airlines; 
• lack of parts in the marketplace; 
• terrorist attacks; 
• future outbreaks of infectious diseases; and 
• acts of God. 





Our U.S. government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  
        Our sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $513.8 million (30.9% of
consolidated sales) in fiscal 2016 (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government contracts is for products and services supporting DoD
logistics and mobility strategy, as well as for expeditionary airlift services and is, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our contracts with
the U.S. government, including the DoD and its contractors, are typically
agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of the
government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop 
7



 
Table of Contents
deployment
worldwide, competitive bidding, U.S. government funding, requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints. 
        The
President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the "Budget Act") on November 2, 2015. The Budget Act raises the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt
until March 2017 and raises the sequester caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. However, unforeseen circumstances could cause an extended debt ceiling breach, which could negatively affect
the timely collection of our U.S. government invoices. 
        Future
congressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federal
debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and
programs we support in particular. 
        If
the existing federal debt limit is not raised, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S.
government is unable to make timely payments. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of
existing contracts or programs which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 




We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts.  
        We sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers under firm contracts providing for
fixed unit prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead, and
other unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to
price a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 




Success at our airframe maintenance facilities is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the
airlines.  
        We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities at five leased facilities. Revenues at these facilities
fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain
airlines operate certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the
required airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute
our operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 




We operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us.  
        The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face
competition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service
companies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors, and other expeditionary airlift service providers. Some of
our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. We believe that our ability to compete
depends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing and effective quality assurance programs. 
8



 
Table of Contents
        Our
government customers, including the DoD, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize small business contractors
or determine to source work internally rather than use us. We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Bid protests could result in significant expense for
us, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid
protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on
both our commercial and government business, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 




We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to
comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation.  
        The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before
we sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards of
airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in
certain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by
compliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us. 
        If
any of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations, or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results of
operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 




If we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be
liable for various penalties or sanctions.  
        We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. These
laws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and orders
restricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information. Certain government contracts provide
audit rights by government agencies, including with respect to performance, costs, internal controls and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In complying with these laws and regulations,
we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if a
government audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions, including suspension or
debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. Our reputation could suffer harm if allegations of impropriety were made or found against us, which
could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue. 




A significant portion of our expeditionary airlift revenue is derived from providing expeditionary
airlift services in Afghanistan.  
        Our expeditionary airlift business derives a significant portion of its revenue from providing expeditionary airlift services in
Afghanistan for the DoD. The U.S. has been reducing military activities in Afghanistan and had previously announced plans to reduce the number of troops in Afghanistan to 5,500 by the end of calendar
year 2016. Recent announcements by the President have indicated the draw down will be slower than originally planned due to the precarious security situation in Afghanistan with the 
9



 
Table of Contents
number
of troops expected to be 8,400 by January 2017. Our expeditionary airlift services revenue will likely experience further declines should troop reductions occur in Afghanistan. 
        We
are bidding on expeditionary airlift contracts in other regions supporting both DoD and non-DoD customers, although there can be no assurance we will be awarded any of these
contracts. Although we expect ongoing demand for expeditionary airlift services in Afghanistan and other regions from the DoD and other governmental departments, we are exposed to the risk that our
expeditionary airlift revenues may further decline if contracts are not renewed, renewed only in part, or are terminated, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition. If we are unable to successfully redeploy aircraft not actively supporting current customers at favorable rates or sell them on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
        U.S.
government contractors that provide support services in theaters of conflict such as Afghanistan have come under increasing scrutiny by agency inspectors general, government
auditors and congressional committees. Investigations pursued by any or all of these groups may result in additional expense, adverse publicity for us and reputational harm, regardless of the
underlying merit of the allegations being investigated. 




We are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.  
        We conduct our business in certain foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts.
Consequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:


• military conflicts, civil strife, and political risks; 
• export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports; 
• compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, United Kingdom ("UK") Anti-bribery Act, and other anti-bribery laws;  
• the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;  
• contract award and funding delays; 
• potential restrictions on transfers of funds; 
• import and export duties and value added taxes; 
• foreign exchange risk; 
• transportation delays and interruptions; and 
• uncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations. 

        In
addition, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union ("EU"). The terms of the UK's potential exit from the EU have yet to be determined and it
is possible there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU countries along with increased regulatory complexities. 
        While
we have adopted and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, we cannot ensure that such
measures will be adequate or that the regions in which we operate will continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all.

Table of Contents




Acquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate
acquired businesses.  
        We explore and have discussions with third parties regarding acquisitions on a regular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, including
difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible assets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key
employees of the acquired business. In addition, acquisitions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. For any
businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to execute our operational, financial, or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition. 




Market values for our aviation products fluctuate, and we may be unable to re-lease or sell aircraft
and engines when their current leases expire.  
        We make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of inventories, aircraft, and engines, which are on lease or
available for lease. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and
future cash flows. Reductions in demand for our inventories or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the
recoverability of our inventories, aircraft, and engines, could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
        We
lease aircraft and engines to our customers on an operating lease basis. Our ability to re-lease or sell these assets on acceptable terms when the lease expires is subject to a number
of factors which drive industry capacity, including new aircraft deliveries, availability of used aircraft and engines in the marketplace, competition, financial condition of our customers, overall
health of the airline industry, and general economic conditions. Our inability to re-lease or sell aircraft and engines could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 




We may need to reduce the carrying value of our assets.  
        We own and distribute a significant amount of aircraft, aircraft parts and components, and manufacturing facilities and related
equipment. The removal of aircraft from service or recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of those assets and record an impairment
charge through earnings to reduce the carrying value.
We recognized impairment charges and other losses of $71.4 million in fiscal 2015 related to our actions to address underperforming product lines and inventories. In addition, if aircraft or
engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline. 
        We
have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record an
impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or one of our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilities
were to lose its authority to operate, we might be required to record an impairment charge. 




We are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our
business strategy, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us.  
        Our ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debt
and equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, state of the aviation
industry, our financial performance, and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not

continue
to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 




Our existing debt includes restrictive and financial covenants.  
        Certain loan and debt agreements, including our Credit Facility, require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some
contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements and
may result in a cross-default under other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could be
declared immediately due and payable. Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 




Our industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered
by insurance may adversely affect our financial condition.  
        Our business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and bodily injury or death which may result if an engine, engine part or
component, airframe part or accessory, or any other aviation product which we have sold, manufactured, or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced, or in which our products are
installed, crashes. We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our risk exposure and commensurate with industry norms. However, claims may arise in the
future, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable
cost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 




Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.  
        Our businesses depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. The Company's
systems and technologies, or those of third parties on which we rely, could fail or become unreliable due to equipment failures, software viruses, cyber threats, terrorist acts, natural disasters,
power failures or other causes. These threats arise in some cases as a result of our role as a defense contractor. 
        Cyber
security threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information, including our customers,
suppliers, subcontractors, and joint venture partners, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or
otherwise protected information, and corruption of data. 
        Although
we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent
security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and could
have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results, and financial condition. 
        Moreover,
expenditures incurred in implementing cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 




We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental
liabilities may adversely affect us.  
        Federal, state, and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal of
hazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other 
12

activities
affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or
of future environmental claims for which we may not have adequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required to pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which
neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were available, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 
        Future
environmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning environmental issues, such as climate change, could adversely affect our operations and increase
operating costs and, through their impact on our customers, reduce demand for our products and services. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the United
States, foreign governments, the International Civil Aviation Organization, or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the
aviation industry. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely be
adverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits. 




We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in
our industry.  
        The industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment,
and methods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with any
new technological
developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 




Our operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages.  
        We are dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce because of the complex nature of many of our products and services.
Furthermore, we have a collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 110 employees. Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers' demands could be jeopardized if we are unable
to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including qualified licensed mechanics, to conduct our business, or if we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage. These and
similar events may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
