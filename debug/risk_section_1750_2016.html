operate five airframe maintenance facilities and one landing gear overhaul facility. Our landing gear overhaul facility is in Miami, Florida, where we repair and overhaul landing
gear, wheels, brakes, and actuators for different types of commercial and military aircraft. Our airframe maintenance facilities are in Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Duluth,
Minnesota; Miami, Florida; and Lake Charles, Louisiana. In fiscal 2016, we closed a regional aircraft maintenance facility in Hot Springs, Arkansas. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activities
in our Aviation Services segment also include the sale and lease of used commercial aircraft. Each sale or lease is negotiated as a separate agreement that includes term,
price, representations, warranties, and lease return provisions. During fiscal 2015, we sold our last two remaining
wholly-owned aircraft and one aircraft owned with joint venture partners. At May&nbsp;31, 2016, our remaining portfolio consisted of three aircraft owned through joint ventures. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

definite contracts which call for the performance of specified services or the delivery of specified products and ID/IQ (i.e.,&nbsp;indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity) contracts. Certain
inventory supply and management and performance-based logistics program agreements reflect negotiated terms and conditions. </FONT></P>

support activities within the Aviation Services segment, we acquire aviation parts and components from domestic and foreign airlines, independent aviation service companies, aircraft
leasing companies, and original equipment manufacturers ("OEM"s). We have ongoing arrangements with OEMs&nbsp;that provide us access to parts, repair manuals, and service bulletins in support of
parts manufactured by them. Although the terms of each arrangement vary, they typically are made on standard OEM terms as to duration, price, and delivery. From time to time, we purchase engines for
disassembly into individual parts and components. These engines may be leased to airlines on a short-term basis prior to disassembly. </FONT></P>

consolidated sales), and $661.7&nbsp;million (38.7% of consolidated sales) in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Sales to government and defense customers are reported in each of our
reportable segments (See Note&nbsp;14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Since such sales are subject to competitive bidding and government funding, no assurance can be given that such
sales will continue at levels previously experienced. The majority of our U.S. government contracts are for products and services supporting the DoD logistics and mobility strategy, as well as for
expeditionary airlift services. Thus, our government contracts have changed, and may continue to change, with fluctuations in defense and other governmental agency spending. Our government contracts
are also subject to termination by the customer; in the event of such a termination we would be entitled to recover all allowable costs incurred by us through the date of termination. </FONT></P>

parts operated in the United States. Similar rules and regulatory authorities exist in other countries. The inspection, maintenance and repair procedures for the various types of aircraft and
equipment are prescribed by these regulatory authorities and can be performed only by certified repair facilities utilizing certified technicians. The FAA requires that various maintenance routines be
performed on aircraft engines, certain engine parts, and airframes at regular intervals based on take off and landing cycles or flight time. Our businesses which sell defense products and services
directly to the U.S. government or through its contractors can be subject to various laws and regulations governing pricing and other factors. </FONT></P>

certificated repair stations. Such certificates, which are ongoing in duration, are required for us to perform authorized maintenance, repair and overhaul services for our customers and are subject to
revocation by the government for non-compliance with applicable regulations. Of the 12 FAA certificated repair stations, 11&nbsp;are in the Aviation Services segment and one is in the Expeditionary

We are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of
that industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high fuel and oil prices, lack of capital, and weak
economic conditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the global
financial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limited
their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
reduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected.
Further, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additional
airline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight
credit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
President signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the "Budget Act") on November&nbsp;2, 2015. The Budget Act raises the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt
until March 2017 and raises the sequester caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. However, unforeseen circumstances could cause an extended debt ceiling breach, which could negatively affect
the timely collection of our U.S. government invoices. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future
congressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federal
debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and
programs we support in particular. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the existing federal debt limit is not raised, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S.
government is unable to make timely payments. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently perform airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities at five leased facilities. Revenues at these facilities
fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain
airlines operate certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the
required airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute
our operational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The markets for our products and services to our commercial, government, and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face
competition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft manufacturers, aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service
companies, other companies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors, and other expeditionary airlift service providers. Some of
our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. We believe that our ability to compete
depends on superior customer service and support, on-time delivery, sufficient inventory availability, competitive pricing and effective quality assurance programs. </FONT></P>

us, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid
protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before
we sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards of
airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in
certain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by
compliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts. These
laws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and orders
restricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information. Certain government contracts provide
audit rights by government agencies, including with respect to performance, costs, internal controls and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In complying with these laws and regulations,
we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if a
government audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions, including suspension or
debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. Our reputation could suffer harm if allegations of impropriety were made or found against us, which
could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue. </FONT></P>

lease aircraft and engines to our customers on an operating lease basis. Our ability to re-lease or sell these assets on acceptable terms when the lease expires is subject to a number
of factors which drive industry capacity, including new aircraft deliveries, availability of used aircraft and engines in the marketplace, competition, financial condition of our customers, overall
health of the airline industry, and general economic conditions. Our inability to re-lease or sell aircraft and engines could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We own and distribute a significant amount of aircraft, aircraft parts and components, and manufacturing facilities and related
equipment. The removal of aircraft from service or recurring losses in certain operations could require us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of those assets and record an impairment
charge through earnings to reduce the carrying value.
We recognized impairment charges and other losses of $71.4&nbsp;million in fiscal 2015 related to our actions to address underperforming product lines and inventories. In addition, if aircraft or
engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline. </FONT></P>

have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record an
impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or one of our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilities
were to lose its authority to operate, we might be required to record an impairment charge. </FONT></P>
