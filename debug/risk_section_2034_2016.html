are directly related to our ability to compete in the intensely competitive global pharmaceutical and chemical markets. We face
intense competition from global and regional distributors of pharmaceutical and chemical products, many of which are large pharmaceutical
and chemical manufacturers as well as distributors. Many of these companies have substantially greater resources than us, including,
among other things, greater financial, marketing and distribution resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete
successfully with any of these companies. In addition, increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced margins
and loss of market share for our products, all of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition,

our business to provide consistent, sequential quarterly growth is affected, in large part, by our participation in the launch
of new products by generic manufacturers and the subsequent advent and extent of competition encountered by these products.</FONT>
<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Revenues and gross profit derived from the sales of generic pharmaceutical products tend to follow
a pattern based on certain regulatory and competitive factors. This competition can result in significant and rapid declines in
pricing with a corresponding decrease in net sales. Net selling prices of generic drugs typically decline over time, sometimes
dramatically, as additional generic pharmaceutical companies receive approvals and enter the market for a given generic product
and competition intensifies. When additional versions of one of our generic products enter the market, we generally lose market
share and our selling prices and margins on that product decline. </FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The approval
process for generic pharmaceutical products often results in the FDA granting final approval simultaneously or within close proximity</FONT>
<FONT STYLE="font-size: 10pt">to a number of generic pharmaceutical products at the time a patent claim for a corresponding branded
product or other market exclusivity expires. This often forces a generic firm to face immediate competition when it introduces
a generic product into the market. Additionally, further generic approvals often continue to be granted for a given product subsequent
to the initial launch of the generic product. These circumstances generally result in significantly lower prices, as well as reduced
margins, for generic products compared to branded products. New generic market entrants generally cause continued price and margin
erosion over the generic product life cycle. As a result, we could be unable to grow or maintain market share with respect to our
generic pharmaceutical products, which could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, operating
results and cash flows.</FONT></P>

are partially dependent upon our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis in relation to our competitors&rsquo; product

prior to being marketed. The process of obtaining FDA/regulatory approval to market new and generic pharmaceutical products is
rigorous, time-consuming, costly and often unpredictable. We may be unable to obtain requisite FDA approvals on a timely basis
for new generic products.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">On November 13, 2013, the FDA issued a proposed
rule (Docket No. FDA-2013-N-0500) titled &quot;Supplemental Applications Proposing Labeling Changes for Approved Drugs and Biological
Products.&quot; Pursuant to the rule, the FDA will change existing regulations to allow generic drug application holders, in advance
of the FDA&rsquo;s review, to distribute revised labeling, to reflect safety-related changes based on newly acquired information.
Currently, the labels of generic drugs must conform to those of the corresponding RLD and any failure-to-warn claims against generic
companies are preempted under U.S. Federal law. Once this rule is released, we could be found liable under such failure-to-warn
claims if we do not revise our labeling to reflect safety-related changes promptly upon receipt of applicable safety information.
While we proactively conduct surveillance for reported safety issues with our products, we cannot guarantee that this will prevent
us from being found liable under a failure-to-warn claim. When this proposed regulatory change is adopted, it could increase our
potential liability with respect to failure-to-warn claims, which, even if successfully defended, could have material adverse effects

have liberal return policies and have been willing to give customers post-sale inventory allowances. Under these arrangements,
from time to time we give our customers credits on our generic products that our customers already hold in inventory after we have
decreased the market prices of the same generic products due to competitive pricing. Therefore, if new competitors enter the marketplace
and significantly lower the prices of any of their competing products, we could reduce the price of our product. As a result, we
would be obligated to provide credits to our customers who are then holding inventories of such products, which could reduce sales
revenue and gross margin for the period the credit is provided. Like our competitors, we also give credits for chargebacks to wholesalers
that have contracts with us for their sales to hospitals, group purchasing organizations, pharmacies or other customers.</P>

The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval set forth herein and approval

process, including drug formulation, testing, and FDA review and approval, often takes three or more years. This process requires
that we expend considerable capital to pursue activities that do not yield an immediate or near-term return. Also, because of the
significant time necessary to develop a product, the actual market for a product at the time it is available for sale may be significantly
less than the originally projected market for the product, including the possibility that the product has become eligible for OTC
sales.&nbsp; If this were to occur, our potential return on our investment in developing the product, if approved for marketing

the Company received letters from the Pulvair Site Group, a group of potentially responsible parties (PRP Group) who are working
with the State of Tennessee (the State) to remediate a contaminated property in Tennessee called the Pulvair site. The PRP Group
has alleged that Aceto shipped hazardous substances to the site which were released into the environment. The State had begun administrative
proceedings against the members of the PRP Group and Aceto with respect to the cleanup of the Pulvair site and the PRP Group has
begun to undertake cleanup. The PRP Group is seeking a settlement of approximately $1,700 from the Company for its share to remediate
the site contamination. Although the Company acknowledges that it shipped materials to the site for formulation over twenty years
ago, the Company believes that the evidence does not show that the hazardous materials sent by Aceto to the site have significantly
contributed to the contamination of the environment and thus believes that, at most, it is a de minimis contributor to the site
contamination. Accordingly, the Company believes that the settlement offer is unreasonable. Management believes that the ultimate
outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or liquidity.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In March 2006, Arsynco received notice from
the EPA of its status as a PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) for a site
described as the Berry&rsquo;s Creek Study Area (&ldquo;BCSA&rdquo;). Arsynco is one of over 150 PRPs which have potential liability
for the required investigation and remediation of the site. The estimate of the potential liability is not quantifiable for a number
of reasons, including the difficulty in determining the extent of contamination and the length of time remediation may require.
In addition, any estimate of liability must also consider the number of other PRPs and their financial strength. In July 2014,
Arsynco received notice from the U.S. Department of Interior (&ldquo;USDOI&rdquo;) regarding the USDOI&rsquo;s intent to perform
a Natural Resource Damage (NRD) Assessment at the BCSA. Arsynco has to date declined to participate in the development and performance
of the NRD assessment process. Based on prior practice in similar situations, it is possible that the State may assert a claim
for natural resource damages with respect to the Arsynco site itself, and either the federal government or the State (or both)
may assert claims against Arsynco for natural resource damages in connection with Berry's Creek; any such claim with respect to
Berry's Creek could also be asserted against the approximately 150 PRPs which the EPA has identified in connection with that site.
Any claim for natural resource damages with respect to the Arsynco site itself may also be asserted against BASF, the former owners
of the Arsynco property. In September 2012, Arsynco entered into an agreement with three of the other PRPs that had previously
been impleaded into New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, et al. v. Occidental Chemical Corporation, et al., Docket
No. ESX-L-9868-05 (the &quot;NJDEP Litigation&quot;) and were considering impleading Arsynco into the same proceeding. Arsynco
entered into an agreement to avoid impleader. Pursuant to the agreement, Arsynco agreed to (1) a tolling period that would not
be included when computing the running of any statute of limitations that might provide a defense to the NJDEP Litigation; (2)
the waiver of certain issue preclusion defenses in the NJDEP Litigation; and (3) arbitration of certain potential future liability
allocation claims if the other parties to the agreement are barred by a court of competent jurisdiction from proceeding against
Arsynco. In July 2015, Arsynco was contacted by an allocation consultant retained by a group of the named PRPs, inviting Arsynco
to participate in the allocation among the PRPs&rsquo; investigation and remediation costs relating to the BCSA. Arsynco declined
that invitation. Since an amount of the liability cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, no accrual is recorded for these
potential future costs. The impact of the resolution of this matter on the Company&rsquo;s results of operations in a particular
reporting period is not currently known.</P>

because of the limited volume of published cases and judicial interpretation and their lack of force as precedents, interpretation
and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve significant uncertainties. New laws and regulations that affect existing
and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively. We cannot predict what effect the interpretation of existing
or new laws or regulations may have on our business in China. If the relevant authorities find that we are in violation of China&rsquo;s
laws or regulations, they would have broad discretion in dealing with such a violation, including, among other things: (i) levying
fines and (ii) requiring that we discontinue any portion or all of our business in China.</P>

Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled
in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification
470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (&ldquo;ASC 470-20&rdquo;). Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account
for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or
partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer&rsquo;s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20
on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the capital in excess of par value section
of shareholders&rsquo; equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original
issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater
amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value
of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because
ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period&rsquo;s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument&rsquo;s
coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and
the trading price of the Notes.</P>

debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury
stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation
of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under
the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares
of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess are issued (which is the policy we intend to follow for settling
such excess). If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in the future for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes,

Company authorized the continuation of the Company&rsquo;s stock repurchase program, expiring in May 2017. Under the stock repurchase
program, the Company is authorized, but not obligated, to purchase up to 5,000 shares of common stock in open market or private
transactions, at prices not to exceed the market value of the common stock at the time of such purchase. Repurchases pursuant to
our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase the volatility of our common stock. The existence of a stock
repurchase program could also potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although the stock repurchase program is intended
to enhance long-term stockholder value, we cannot provide assurance that this will occur. The stock repurchase program may be suspended
or terminated at any time, and we have no obligation to repurchase any amount of our common stock under the program.</P>
