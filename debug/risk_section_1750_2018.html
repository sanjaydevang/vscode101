General  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AAR CORP. and its subsidiaries are referred to herein collectively as "AAR," "Company," "we," "us," and "our" unless the context indicates
otherwise. AAR was founded in 1951, organized in 1955 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1966. We are a diversified provider of products and services to the worldwide aviation and government and
defense markets. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning
in fiscal 2015, we implemented a comprehensive strategic plan to narrow our strategy to focus on our best-in-class aviation and expeditionary services through our two business
segments: Aviation Services and Expeditionary Services. We sold our Telair Cargo Group for cash of $714&nbsp;million, resulting in pre-tax gains of $198.6&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2015 (and $27.7&nbsp;million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 from the receipt of contingent consideration). We used the proceeds from the sale in fiscal 2015 to reduce our total debt and
return capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through
execution of our strategic plan over the last three years, we have succeeded in expanding customer relationships and securing new flight hour component inventory management and
repair programs work with multiple international commercial customers and government customers. We also invested in our rotable assets to support these programs and continued our focus on expanding
our business development resources. These investments in our supply chain activities have allowed us to increase market share, expand our customer base, and enlarge our geographic footprint. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
fiscal 2018, we began the ramp-up for the 15-year, U.S. Air Force Landing Gear Performance-Based Logistics One program. Under the program, we are providing total supply chain
management including purchasing, distribution and inventory control to support all landing gear components for the U.S. Air Force's fleet of C-130, KC-135 and E-3 aircraft. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
fiscal 2018, we also began providing services to the U.S. Department of State ("DoS") under the INL/A Worldwide Aviation Support Services ("WASS") contract. This contract leverages
our capabilities in aviation services, including flight operations, supply chain logistics, and other services. We are the prime contractor on this 10-year performance-based contract to globally
operate and maintain the DoS fleet of fixed and rotary-wing aircraft. We successfully completed the transition and phase-in of
the WASS program in June 2018. We have full operational capability at all contract sites, which include Afghanistan, Iraq, Panama, Peru, and Patrick Air Force Base as well as support locations in
Brevard County, Florida. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
long-term strategy continues to emphasize the return of capital to shareholders. Over the past three years, we have returned $82.6&nbsp;million to shareholders through common stock
repurchases of $51.7&nbsp;million and dividends of $30.9&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
remain in a strong financial position to further execute on our strategy in fiscal 2019. Both our commercial and government businesses are executing on our many contract wins and will
continue to deliver growth in fiscal 2019. Our cash on hand plus unused capacities on our Revolving Credit Facility and accounts receivable financing program was $473&nbsp;million at May&nbsp;31,
2018. We expect to invest opportunistically in expanding our comprehensive suite of services to the global commercial aviation and government and defense markets. We continue to have the flexibility
in our balance sheet allowing us to invest in our growth. As we generate positive cash flow, we will continue our strategy of returning capital to our shareholders without hampering our future
operating flexibility. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Aviation Services segment provides aftermarket support and services for the commercial aviation and government and defense markets and
accounted for 93% of our sales in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016. In this segment, we also provide inventory management and distribution services, maintenance, repair and overhaul ("MRO"), and
engineering services. Business activities in this segment are primarily conducted through AAR Supply Chain,&nbsp;Inc.; AAR Government Services,&nbsp;Inc.; AAR Aircraft&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Engine

our airline and government customers' maintenance activities. The types of services provided under these programs include material planning, sourcing, logistics, information and program management,

operate seven airframe maintenance facilities and one landing gear overhaul facility. Our landing gear overhaul facility is in Miami, Florida, where we repair and overhaul landing
gear, wheels, brakes, and actuators for different types of commercial and military aircraft. Our U.S. airframe maintenance facilities are in Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Duluth,
Minnesota; Miami, Florida; and Rockford, Illinois and our Canadian airframe maintenance facilities are in Trois Rivieres, Quebec and Windsor, Ontario. In addition, we also announced a joint venture
with Indamer Aviation which will develop and operate an airframe maintenance facility in India. The facility is currently under construction and is expected to begin operations in fiscal 2019. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
majority of our product sales are made pursuant to standard commercial purchase orders. Government sales are generally made under standard types of government contracts which can
include firm fixed-price contracts, cost plus fixed fee contracts, and time-and-materials contracts. Some of our contracts call for the performance of specified services or the delivery of specified
products under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity ("ID/IQ") arrangements. Certain inventory supply and management and performance-based logistics program agreements reflect negotiated terms and

extrusions, balsa, and other necessary supplies from several vendors. Where necessary, we have been able to obtain raw materials and other inventory items from numerous sources for each segment at
competitive prices, terms, and conditions, and we expect to be able to continue to do so. </FONT></P>

to government and defense customers are reported in each of our reportable segments (See&nbsp;Note&nbsp;13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Since such sales are
subject to competitive bidding and government funding, no assurance can be given that such sales will continue at levels previously experienced. The majority of our U.S. government sales are for
products and services supporting the DoD logistics and mobility strategy. Thus, our government contracts have changed, and may continue to change, with fluctuations in defense and other governmental
agency spending. Our government contracts are also subject to termination by the customer; in the event of such a

United States. Similar rules and regulatory authorities exist in other countries. The inspection, maintenance and repair procedures for the various types of aircraft and equipment are prescribed by
these regulatory authorities and can be performed only by certified repair facilities utilizing certified technicians. The FAA requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft
engines, certain engine parts, and airframes at regular intervals based on take off and landing cycles or flight time. Our businesses which sell defense products and services directly to the U.S.
government or through its contractors can be subject to various laws and regulations governing pricing and other factors. </FONT></P>

We are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of that
industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high fuel and oil prices, lack of capital, and weak economic
conditions. As a result of these and other events, from time to time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. The impact of instability in the global
financial markets may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past been impacted by tight credit markets, which limited
their ability to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
reduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected.
Further, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines, and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additional
airline bankruptcies, and in such circumstances we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight
credit conditions and customer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. </FONT></P>

government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by
larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation, including the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt (the "debt ceiling"). These issues could negatively affect the
timely collection of our U.S. government invoices. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future
congressional appropriation and authorization of defense spending and the application of sequestration remain marked by significant debate and an uncertain schedule. The federal
debt limit continues to be actively debated as plans for long-term national fiscal policy are discussed. The outcome of these debates could have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and
programs we support in particular. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
there are funding delays and constraints, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts even if the U.S. government is

based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent of outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. In addition, certain airlines operate
certain new fleet types and/or newer generation aircraft and we may not have contractual arrangements to service these aircraft nor technicians trained and certified to perform the required airframe
maintenance, repair and overhaul activities. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute our operational

government customers, including the DoD, may turn to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for certain work, or may utilize small business contractors
or determine to source work internally rather than use us. We are also impacted by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Bid protests could result in significant expense for
us, contract modifications, or the award decision being overturned and loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of an award, the resolution can extend the time
until the contract activity can begin, and delay earnings. These competitive pressures, with potential impacts on both our

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before we sell
any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards of
airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in
certain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by
compliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us. </FONT></P>

regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations, and orders
restricting the use and dissemination of classified information under the U.S. export control laws and the export of certain products and technical information and safeguarding of contractor
information systems. Certain government contracts provide audit rights by government agencies, including with respect to performance, costs, business systems, internal controls and compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including
contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if a government audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil
penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions, including suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. Our reputation could suffer harm if allegations of impropriety
were made or found against us, which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue. </FONT></P>

classified as a discontinued operation. In addition, if aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that
require these parts or services, our revenues may decline. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
make a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of our assets including historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and
expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and future cash flows. Differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our assets
could result in impairment charges in future periods, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. </FONT></P>

have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions. If we are unable to achieve the projected levels of operating results, it may be necessary to record an
impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and related intangible assets. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $9.8&nbsp;million
related to our COCO business. Similarly, if we were to lose a key customer or one of our airframe maintenance or landing gear facilities were to lose its authority to operate, we might be required to
record an impairment charge. </FONT></P>
