34. The Companys reliance on a small number of customers for a large portion of its revenues could harm its business and prospects.
35. The Company conducts its business worldwide, which exposes it to a number of difficulties in coordinating its international activities and dealing with multiple regulatory environments.
36. The Companys lengthy sales cycle requires it to incur significant expenses with no assurance that it will generate revenue or recover such expenses.
37. The Companys business is dependent upon governmental policies and appropriations.
38. Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for the Companys products or increase its expenses.
39. The Companys reliance on only a limited number of suppliers for some key components for its products could harm its business and prospects.
40. Fluctuations in the Companys quarterly operating results may cause its stock price to fluctuate.
41. The Company could incur substantial costs as a result of product liability claims and adverse publicity if its X-ray inspection systems fail to detect bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats to personal safety.
42. The Companys insurance may be insufficient to protect it from product liability claims.
43. The Company may not be able to fund its research and development activities.
44. The Companys success depends on new product development.
45. The Companys success depends upon its ability to adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements.
46. The Company may not be able to compete successfully.
47. The Companys business could be harmed if it is unable to protect its intellectual property.
48. The Companys business may be materially and adversely affected by infringement claims initiated by the Company or its competitors.
49. The Companys success depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified management professionals.
50. Future sales of the Companys common stock by existing stockholders could depress the market price of the Companys common stock.
51. Existing external financing may not be available in the future.
52. The volatility of the Companys stock price could adversely affect an investment in the Companys common stock.
53. Provisions in the Companys articles of organization and the Companys shareholder rights plan may have the effect of discouraging advantageous offers for the Companys business or common stock, and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Companys common stock.
54. Transmission X-ray Technology:Transmission images are created from X-rays that pass through the object that is being examined. Medical X-ray images are a type of transmission X-ray. In transmission imaging, the detector measures the relative intensity of the X-rays that pass directly through the object. The degree to which X-rays are transmitted through an object is dependant upon the size of the X-ray source and the composition and quantity of the material in the path of the X-ray beam. Low energy sources are used to scan smaller objects such as parcels and baggage, and high energy sources are used for scanning large items such as trucks and cargo containers. Transmission X-ray images are useful for seeing through the object of interest. A transmission image, however, represents an aggregate of all objects in the path on the beam and can therefore be difficult to interpret.
55. Z Backscatter Technology:Many of the Companys X-ray systems utilize AS&Es patented Z Backscatter technology. The term Backscatter refers to those X-rays thatscatteroff of the object under examinationbacktoward the X-ray source. Z Backscatter detectors capture these scattered X-rays which are then used to create highly readable, photo-like images.
56. OtherTechnologies:Two other technologies employed by AS&E are Shaped Energy and Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD). Shaped Energy technology is a specialized form of high energy transmission X-ray which is used in AS&Es OmniView product line. Radioactive Threat Detection (RTD) is a technology which is used to find radioactive materials in vehicles.
57. CargoSearch Inspection Systems:The CargoSearch family of systems includes non-intrusive inspection products which are primarily used for the screening of trucks, cars, cargo containers, pallets, and air cargo. These systems are used at locations including border crossings, seaports, military bases, railroad centers, airports, and cargo and transportation hubs. The CargoSearch systems are designed to combat trade fraud, drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, and terrorism. The CargoSearch family includes:
58. Z Backscatter Systems:Z Backscatter Systems include imaging systems that use Z Backscatter imaging only.
59. ParcelSearch Inspection Systems:ParcelSearch systems are designed for the non-intrusive X-ray scanning of parcels, baggage, and mail. They are primarily located in government facilities, airports, commercial office buildings, high-security federal facilities and convention centers. The ParcelSearch family includes:
60. Personnel Screening:Personnel screening is a crucial part of any threat detection effort. Today, threats can take the smallest of forms and are often easily hidden on a person. With the advent of suicide bombings, personnel screening has taken on an even more important role. Personnel screening is also important in the effort to intercept prohibited substances, such as drugs and alcohol.
61. Contract Research & Development:AS&E engages in a variety of contract research and development (CRAD) programs, mostly for agencies of the US government. AS&E pursues CRAD opportunities which it believes provide avenues for advancing our core technologies or developing product offerings for strategic customers or markets. One such important program is the CAARS (Cargo Advanced Radiography System) program for DHS Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO). CAARS is a program under which AS&E is developing advanced detection technology for inspecting cargo containers for nuclear materials.
62. Service and Support:AS&Es Field Service Engineers (FSEs) provide support services on most of AS&Es X-ray inspection systems worldwide. FSEs are located at AS&E offices in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and North America. In addition, Technical Support is provided at the Companys headquarters in Billerica, Massachusetts. AS&E provides comprehensive, cost-effective spare parts solutions customized for each system. The Company maintains an inventory of field-replaceable components in order to meet customer needs for spare parts.
63. Models 101Z, 101ZZ, and 101XL:conveyor-based systems allowing rapid inspection of high volumes of luggage and other packages.
64. ·tariff regulations.
65. ·changes in the volume or timing of product orders.
66. ·breadth of the sales and service organization.
67. ·developments in the Companys relationships with its customers and suppliers.
