In June 2017, we announced a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. As a result of this organizational realignment, the Company’s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific &amp; Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. Sales through our NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment.</font></div><div style="l
